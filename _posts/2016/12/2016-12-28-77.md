Dinner with E and C. Nice tradition. I still run absolutely low at the end and stop talking though. The Bay Lights are only for the north. The Kowloon cafe is always nice, noticeably good this time, mango-go-go and hot soy milk.

Lunch with mom at home was good. More porridge! Potstickers. After early hospital appointment.

Also finished up work. Not going to do any more of that this break. No documentation, fuck that.

Today was nice and long.

Tomorrow. Drive to Pleasanton? I need something random.
