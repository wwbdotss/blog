Sat around waiting for mom's chemo session. Worst. I couldn't concentrate or do anything else but feel sad. Whole day wasted.

Did my accounting. Waited all year to do it, but because of cancer, it got all ruined too. It should have been awesome. I did feel a slight euphoria when I realized how much money I added this year. Posted a screenshot, so vain. Proud though. Through the horrible past year, money persevered.

I still can't get my sleeping under control.

I will do more planks.
