Going to watch more Westworld. Dinner at not very good Chinese restaurant with first aunt and uncle. My great-side-uncle? is going to die. They've taken him off chemo and it's only pain management now. Work was incomplete. I didn't send the last test because the project manager was in happy hour and I didn't want to interrupt with stupid meaningless work that I didn't care about and neither should anyone on a Friday at 5. My right nostril still hurts. I bet there is still a cut in there that keeps on re-opening because I pick my nose and twitch it and stretch my nose all the time. I didn't realize how much I do this until I got the cut. I have to just let it relax and breath at ease. Let it be.
