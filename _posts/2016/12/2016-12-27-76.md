Jook with mom and grandma. It was pretty good. Blue Danube, large chai and mixed salad. E's house, fed the cat. Ramen, pretty ok. Abandoned houses at night on Youtube.

I wrote at the cafe. I'm so close to finishing Chapter 4. Just another solid two days and I could wrap it up. I should power through it in one. I want that midway point. Just repeat four more times. It would be roughly equivalent to a draft 1 for it's totally my Draft 2. Can't wait.

Will wake up early tomorrow to drive mom to the hospital for blood draw. Then dinner with C and E. The middle, I'm not sure what I would do. I'm not fond of those empty stretches of time, or place. They are easy wastelands. I will finish up work. Then maybe I'll treat myself to something. At this rate, I'm not going to watch any Survivor.
