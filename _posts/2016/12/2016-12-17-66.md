Happy today because of friends.

Spent all day trying to bake pies. Got mad and raised my voice at grandma, which I felt immediately guilty for, of course. I lose my temper.

Annual G and R Christmas dinner. Good to feel included and invited. I didn't connect much with C or V or J, and not really T, but everyone else was pretty good. I still can't keep up with conversations. I fall silent pretty quickly and sink into the background. Despite my shit, I still felt good overall. This would be something I'd hate to lose, but lose I will eventually.

Trying to end posts on high notes. Maybe that would help.
