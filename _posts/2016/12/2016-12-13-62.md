I feel so patronized at work. I don't like it and I don't know how to confront it.

I probably won't eat at Curry Express or King of Thai for a while. Fried rice is not good going forward. Everything getting ruined before me. Even the frozen yogurt place in the food court is not as great as before. I can't see it as a good standby anymore.

Didn't write. Didn't do push ups. Tired from the long ass commute in the rain and dark and traffic. The worst.
