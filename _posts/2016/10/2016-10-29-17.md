We only had time to catch the last tour. It was raining lightly and recreated the mood I saw Iceland in my mind. All my pictures through the steamed up bus windows had droplets and streaks in them. I took as many of the regular houses along the way, but then I got dizzy from the looking back and forth. The earphone narration was lowkey. There really isn't that much in Iceland, but I really like it for that.

It's crazy that there are only 330,000 people here in the whole country. That's less than half of San Francisco.

Hakarl is fine! I don't know what people are complaining about. There is a bit of nastiness at the end when the uriney ammonia funk rises up. The platter I got only had a few tiny pieces in a little mason jar, like this whole containment protocol lol. I think it was because people would only try one piece and waste the rest. I wish I had more. It tasted like cuttlefish. Not bad at all.

Fruits and vegetables are rare.

I didn't sleep at all tonight. Terrible. The jet lag has finally slammed home. Plus the weird day and a half that was yesterday. My sleeping schedule is fucked up.
