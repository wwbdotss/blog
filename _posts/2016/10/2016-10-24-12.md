Finally started packing. Packed most of the stuff I need. I'm at about 18 something pounds. I have a 22 pound limit.

J at work liked the Bose earphones, which was nice.

Had a quick few messages on Twitter with V, which was great. I could tell she thinks she made some assumptions and disclaimed a little, which made me really like her at that moment. I tried my best to defuse that and show that it's all good, but I didn't do it as well as I could have. This kind of thing is so important.

It rained! Always a good day. My heart swelled some more as I walked through Chinatown in this weather. It was so picturesque.

Getting back on the basketball wagon. It should be fun if I don't take it super seriously.

New thing: shredded chicken burrito for lunch at the Mexican place on the left.
