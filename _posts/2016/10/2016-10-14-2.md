Ate at Wako for E's birthday with S. The food was lots more garnish and presentation and performance and frills than core substance. Insubstantial. Good for novelty and change of pace of experience though. It's a good thing.

KK's last day at work. Might or might not come back after maternity leave. I don't think I'll ever see her again, which is sad.

Inconsequential day at work, did nothing again, what's new. Felt replaceable and incompetent during all-hands, like always. I don't contribute in any noticeable way. I will ride out my indifference and inconsequence.

Free pizza. It was not very good.

It rained! Marvelous. Great morning. Woke up even earlier, at 6. Dark gray pre-dawn, rain and wind outside the window. Bliss.

The roof at work didn't leak which was amazing. No more tarp and bucket business.

Felt good about raising a problem during a meeting. The retina bit does indeed have to be rewritten if we want 2x in web client. It was an actual real thing instead of the stupid fluff and agreeable noises I usually make.

Listened to like two hours of Dan Carlin at Danube after work waiting for dinner at 8:45.
