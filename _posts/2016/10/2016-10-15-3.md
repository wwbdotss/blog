Woke up late because it was Saturday.

Had pho ga with mom and then groceries.

Spent rest of afternoon not really doing anything. It's unclear even after only a day. Less than a day. My memory!

Later, went to shabu with everyone for October birthdays. First went to the one on Geary. Connected that with Clement for some reason. So thought I was safely early and moseyed around wasting time then realized and had to rush for like a mile and it had started raining. Not the best. Got there and was glad I wasn't the last one. Typical dinner like the other times. Need to get G a present. Didn't manage to talk to A, which I regret.

Dropped off the car. E and S picked me up. Went off to their place and got high for the first time. Holy shit. The past and the present were sliced up into 10-second slippery wedges that shifted and slid and passed each other like small tectonic ice plates and would momentarily align for a second when I try to concentrate and line up the sequence of events, then everything would drift apart again. Memory and reality weren't dependable.

Missed blogging schedule. This is going to keep happening for sure.
