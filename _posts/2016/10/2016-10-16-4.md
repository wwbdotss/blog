Woke up in a haze on E's air mattress. Peed. Thought it was maybe 7 in the morning by the gray light. Nope. It was almost 10. It was raining peacefully. I guessed I was the only one awake.

I left a note and left. I stared hard at the outside world and probed for any weirdness in my memory. Things seemed to flow normally, so that was good. I navigated from covered parking space to covered parking space through the rain to the street and called a lyft to SF. It was $25.

Home and did nothing. Well, I checked things off. Writing and push ups. I despise Sunday afternoons. It helped that it was raining. I went out for a walk to the library and got a strawberry ice cream cone. They had built public exercise equipment, which is new and interesting. I kept thinking of ways people could steal or vandalize them, but maybe they won't.

C did a lot of work and forwarded me the bookings of all the tours and Airbnb. I feel hella lazy. I'll try to make up for it and research restaurants. Best part of traveling with someone is being able to eat together. Something else I despise: eating dinner alone, especially when traveling. Lunch is fine. But dinner? No. It just sucks. So I'm super looking forward to the food part of the trip.

Home again for hot pot for V's birthday with parents. More hot pot! The place was busier than I expected. Maybe they will survive long enough unlike the rash of shabu and hot pot places that had popped up over the past decade.

Home again again, will do nothing.
