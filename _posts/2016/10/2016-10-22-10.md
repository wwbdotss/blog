Weekends suck because my mom has cancer.

Made it a point to wake up early at 6:30 to see what it's like. I'm claiming mornings for myself. They feel good. I have the most energy and clarity. I know the rest of the day will be downhill from there. How can I get more energy.

I have to rethink this, for weekends. After I wrote and did my push ups, I had a lot of time, but no energy, so I wasted it anyway. I would have felt better if I slept an extra two hours or something. I never want to let myself wake up naturally because I would oversleep, and that is the worst outcome of all. I've set a time for 8 tomorrow. If I get my sleeping rhythm right, I would wake up before then. If I don't wake up naturally, then I at least cut it off at the bud and not oversleep. Good? Good.

I walked way up and around, past Baker Beach. This was my second time and I found a trail next to the road that I didn't like the first time. Next time, I'll make it to the bridge.

My "j-pillow" came. It's kind of weak. I hate marketing and falling for marketing.

I hate sleeping in my car too, which I did today because I didn't want to go home. I will keep the pillow there and make the best of things.

I resisted folding in the face of confrontation, refuted with evidence and logic, and prevailed. Hells yes. Turned an awful-feeling day around immediately and blasted me through the night with good feels momentum. Fantastico.
