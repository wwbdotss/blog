Said goodbye to G, but it was those yearny talks with repeated hugs that have no core to them. We never had much of a relationship, pretty surface work relationship. I wonder if any of my relationships will ever be as deep as I want.

I should have everything ready for Iceland, but whatever. I don't care to try to control everything about it anymore. Things are going to happen. No more stressing.

What even happened today? It was a big plate of nothing. New thing was that I went into the hardware store and bought an outlet adaptor. I also tried a new salad for lunch, but that's nothing really.

Put a shit ton of shit on the lappy for the plane. I'm going to bring hella entertainment. Chances are, I'll end up listening to Art Bell the entire flight.

The last thing I'm packing is the computer and the charger. Yes, that should really be everything. I have to make sure to wear extra layers. I'm underestimating how cold it would be. <i>Ice</i>land.
