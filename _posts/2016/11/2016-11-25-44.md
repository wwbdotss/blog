Not as jealous of Ben Brown. I don't want his life.

I really need to see the dermatologist. I have this third nipple growth thing in the middle of my chest. What is up with that. And my long term back mole.

Warriors game with K tomorrow. Can't wait to eat nachos.

Looking forward to lunch with mom tomorrow too at the noodle place.

Also looking forward to getting the Christmas bonus at work. That's one nice thing that's so much better than at my previous place; I get the check actually before Christmas instead of like in freaking March.

I can't help but to read Brandon Sanderson. As much as I don't like his writing, I keep buying his books. They are white bread and easy to digest. They give me what I want apparently.

How long can I stay at my job? I'm definitely not going to quit on my own unless I have a really really good reason to. I will leave no doubt when they kick me out. Something is going to happen. The setup now can't last forever. Just a matter of when. If that happens, I would fall apart.

Also looking forward to recording my money for the last quarter. I like counting my money. Like Scrooge.
