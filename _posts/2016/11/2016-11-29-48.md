Wasted time watching Patrick Rothfuss stream. I gravitate towards people with glamorous things happening to them. So many vicarious voyeurisms.

Coughing like crazy, it's hard to sleep. I've deviated so far from my habits. I'll try to get up early tomorrow so I can at least do push ups in the morning. I feel time pressure at work because I haven't done any real work except trying to set up all the crap that I need. I should just need notepad, right, what the fuck is all this chaff.
