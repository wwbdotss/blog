I played Heroes, I'm a failure. No regrets? Lots of regret.

It's getting super cold now.

Writing has been super slow. This is the part where I have to actually write, no surprise. I don't know how long this is going to take me to get through. I'm writing like one sentence a day.

Nothing much happening.
