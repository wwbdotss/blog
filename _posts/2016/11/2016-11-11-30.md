Ate at D&A Cafe with E. Nice. Hate how these can't linger like before he got a girlfriend, to whom he has to return. But oh well. Another example of not getting everything I want and always having to accommodate for the crappy parts. There will always be crappy parts.

Wrote a letter to V. Felt great. Can't wait to send her the souvenir.

Those things are good and people-related and I need more of those. Nothing else matters right. I wish I could be better at this at work and socialize with my coworkers more. I really like them and they are great.

Home is better because mom is on the upswing from the chemo until next week when she has to go back down into the depths. It's such a horrible situation, but at least there are these upswings.

Tomorrow? I guess I'll write more? Or work on the site. I don't know, there isn't much left I can turn to. Walk I bet. Take more pictures. Read? I need more of that. This is the perfect time with my rejection of the news. Probably the site. I want to super finish that and go back to posting pictures again.
