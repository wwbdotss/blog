So bad at work. My laptop got stolen. I feel guilty for leaving it at work even though I overheard that I shouldn't. I didn't take the precaution even though I knew the risks. No one reassured me that it wasn't my fault. Either it's so obvious to everyone that it isn't, or that they're all talking about it behind my back. I'm a fledgling paranoid.

Huge headache at the end of the day. I hate how dim the office is. Also the stress of not having my computer set up. I need light.
