Starting to feel sick. Scratchy throat. Ugh. It's been a couple of years since I was last really sick, like stay home in bed feeling dizzy. Come on immune system.

Bought these seeds from Trader Joe's. Sacha Inchi seeds. I don't know.

The first three weeks of November are my favorite time of the year. Already seasonal, in that mood, but before the major Thanksgiving and Christmas days weigh in.

Going to sleep. I don't want to wake up sick for real.
