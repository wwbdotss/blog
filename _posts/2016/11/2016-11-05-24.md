The secret to not getting jetlag when you come back from vacation is to spend the entire time abroad as if you were on local time! Apparently. Slept like a baby and woke up at a sensible time.

Ate at Fresh Choice, which is now once again a Fresh Choice instead of a California Fresh. Weird corporate stuff must have happened. It was the best meal I've had in a long time.

Bought random stuff at Target. Drove around aimless. Ended up on Clement and the Blue Danube. Then crepes of course.

Home, gave parents souvenirs. Worked on the site for a good chunk. Felt awesome.
