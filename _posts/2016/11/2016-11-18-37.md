Played Heroes at the Japantown cafe. I really wanted to blow through these campaigns so I can unlock the locked campaigns that I, in the fifteen years or something that I've played Heroes, have never seen before. There is a rush here.

Weird and awkward at work, and nothing went my way, not really. The project I was excited about working on the day before, I got no recognition that I got the test in order, and it's going to someone else. I didn't even mention it, thinking privately in my inner mind how sensitive I am to any ego or self-promotion. I'm approaching this all wrong. Only three days at work next week. No work will get done.

Tired. Sleep. What will Saturday bring. What will I do.

Took a Lyft back. I hate how raw it is. It's the type of environment, in a full Lyft line, when it's stark how at a disadvantage my exterior physical appearance and demeanor are. It's all in my head of course, but I can't help thinking that if I were someone else, someone with confidence and exudes glowing personality when I step into a car even with strangers, I would leave a good impression and interact with people well. But instead, I think how unimpressive I am, my first impression, and how little presence I have. I have to first fix my mental state, then my physical appearance, and the combination of those two would give me what I'm after.
