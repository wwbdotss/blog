Played Heroes all day.

I filled in the transitions between sections in Chapter 4. Feels good to take advantage of past work.

I did some sit ups and weights. I'm going to rotate those into Habitica, alterating them on top of the base of push ups.

Should I stay up and play some more Heroes? Why not. What's going to happen? I wake up at like 10 or 11. I will probably miss a writing day. Oh well. I take the consequences.
