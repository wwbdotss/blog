Election Day tomorrow. It's almost over. Good riddance.

Really didn't want to go back to work. Just want to do the minimum forever, and not knowing what went on for the past week put a wrench in that a bit. I have to re-engage and restart the mediocre engine.

Work has become darker and darker, morale is failing for me. There is much less energy and light. H started a Slack but no one posts anything there. It's just her links, which is so sad. I wonder how long she will last. It seems to me the only people who are staying are unambitious people like me who just wants to hang on and not looking for anything else.

Was super hungry the entire day. I need to eat more but I don't want to spend money on food. I need to buy and cook again. I need to wake up earlier. 6:30 must. Get up at 7. Get ready for bed at 9:30 and be in bed by 10. Now is the right time to do that too because of the daylight saving time bonus.

My habiticas are all messed up. The only thing that's going is the blogging. I think I can sustain this, but it's also the least helpful to improving myself.

My vision is getting so bad now. The office is dark. I get no sun at all. And stress. I'm just going to be blind.

Can't wait for tomorrow. Really want to read the articles and teardowns of the GOP. Their tears are so delicious.

My foot is messed up too. It hurts. I can't walk anymore. I'm going to take the bus, so even that smidgeon of delight and pleasure in my day is crushed and torn away.
