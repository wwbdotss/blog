Saw Dream Theater with E in San Jose at an auditorium-like venue. Old nerds, as E put it. The band is older than I am. It was a story show. The songs accompanied Final Fantasy-like art and transition effects. The story is pretty lame. The lights and visuals were interesting though. Loud. I plugged my fingers into my ears for the second half. The band also asked people to get up and I didn't feel like it so I was the only one sitting there in my entire row with my fingers plugged into my ears. What a great audience member. I felt great though. I nodded my head a little to show that I wasn't trying to look like a disapproving asshole; I was just doing what I wanted and didn't let what other people thought prevent me from doing it. I need to do this more often in life in general.

Ate at a great bun bo hue place. Magical. A top meal on my list for sure. Flavors were hella vivid. Vietnamese food is now my favorite cuisine.

Stitched more of Chapter 4. The rangers could not come in. The camp has to remain secret.

Played even more Heroes. I am now into a new campaign, whoo! Unlocked at last.
