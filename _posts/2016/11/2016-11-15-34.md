I will stop playing Heroes until I finish Chapter 4. That will be the deal. I need this to not get away from me. Why is having fun so much easier than work?

Work is regular. Would it only stay this way forever and out of my mind and worry.

When it's the off-week without the chemo, things are steady state at home too. I really don't know what I have until it's gone.

Not even Veronica Belmont's sexy voice can keep me listening to the Sword and Laser show. The chemistry is just so awful between the hosts. It's the number one most important thing. A podcast could be about the most mundane thing. As long as the hosts know each other and can talk to each other naturally, nothing else matters to me.

Picked up The Lions of Al-Rassan. Prologue's pretty good. That first paragraph showed restraint, efficiency, and skill. That kept me reading. I need to do something like that. A quick show of literary competence, before getting a relatable character on the screen. I think readers, at least myself, need to be both intrigued by compelling characters and reassured that they and the story will be in good hands before committing.
