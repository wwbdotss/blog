Warriors game was great. We won, and that's all that ever matters. Good to see K too.

I don't want to sleep and just play Heroes.

I've suspended my daily habits because I was (am?) sick. Good excuse. With the exception of blogging. This has its own legs.

Tomorrow? I need to get outside. Cafe perhaps? I could restart the habits with some push ups. Those are the next easiest thing to do. Writing is forever the hardest and the thing I need to do. I'm going to get some KDP this quarter, whoo.
