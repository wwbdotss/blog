Finished the site! Spent the whole day on it. Well, half the day. The other half I finished preparing Chapter 4. Today was very productive.

I wonder how long I can keep up not following the news. I'm not even checking The Verge until probably mid-next year so I don't stumble onto anything related at all to politics. I should just reinstall the Trump filter again. Buh. Checked the site and got a face full of Trump. Fuck that. Filter reinstalled.

Put stuff into new wallet yesterday. Feels clean.

I really need to do something about my appearance, clothes, skin, face, everything. I've just left everything in shambles.

It takes hella long to regenerate the site for some reason. Like 8-9 seconds vs. 2 seconds for this one. I bet it's the nav.

Sleeping so late today. I can feel myself messing up my schedule for Monday.

I got some popcorn chicken after not having any for a long time. Still good.
