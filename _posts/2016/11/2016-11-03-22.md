Walked hella lot more. Bought more souvenirs. It is yesterday again. Tired. Hate how it's the last real day here. Don't want to go back to real life. Don't want to pack.

Walked through the woods close by in the morning. Saw weird ass things there. First, there was this partially built shack thing made of sticks. It looked like some artifact the rangers put up, to show how to survive in the woods, or how early people did? I don't know. Then later I wandered off the path and ran into this partially weaved tapestry, rug that was using the branches to support the threads. I was like what the fuck fuck?? I had read on a sign earlier about "relics" strewn amidst the woods there by the military, and I was thinking maybe bunkers or cement fortifications or something. I don't think that partially build shack and the creepy-ass rug were it.

The thermal pool was dismal looking and no one was there. I can't imagine it being an attractive attraction. I took some pictures in the rain and morning light though.

The Pearl was stupid too. Nothing there.

The mall was just like any other mall in the world. Nothing interesting to see. But that meant I had to go all the way back to the harbor to get the scarf for dad. Fuck. I trudged.

Got my hot dog, so there was that. Finally got some Noodle Station too.

The end! Iceland is over for me until Iceland 2, when I would properly take agency.

I will order more room service because I hate things ending.
