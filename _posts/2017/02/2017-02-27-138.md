A nothing day, but I need to stop being so negative. No news is good news. Nothing is goodthing.

D went on a train through the mountains, I want some of that. Why don't I? I have three potential travel buddies. E, C, and K. Maybe E, and V? Could add L for filler, but I really don't want to ask him to do anything. Is that everyone? Maybe A.

New thing today was? Did I actually do a new thing? I'm listening to new Drake songs. I guess that's something. New podcasts! Signed up for kp. More than covered this.
