Finished latest Brandon Sanderson anthology. I feel the same way after reading every Brandon Sanderson book. Annoyed with his characters and annoying attempts at humor and wit and I still read it because of his action scenes and set up for the endings. He knows how to end things, which is something I can learn from him. It's the piece that makes up for all the crap everything else. This tells me that a good plot can overcome bad characters.

Today was a nothing day.
