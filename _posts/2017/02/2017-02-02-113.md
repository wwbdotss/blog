OK day too. Went out after work. Walked around the north route down to the Embarcadero. Love Chinatown. Wanted to get Blaze Pizza but decided to just eat at Squat and Gobble again. Huge salad, but don't want to eat that again. I left the leftovers on top of a trash can. A bad meal, actually. Spent $20 on a cup of chili and some kale, pretty much. I should have gotten pizza. Then Starbucks and watched Ben Brown. Walked home, somewhat at ease. The mortgage interest statement came! I can do my taxes now and get that accounting done, and forecast. Excited.

I just want tomorrow to be normal and keep this streak going.
