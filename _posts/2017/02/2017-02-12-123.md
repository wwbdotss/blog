I'm becoming a worse and worse person. I hate how success depends on other people. Any success. I'm super anti-social at this point, and not caring that I am. This is who I am apparently, at my base level. I can hype myself up and put in lots of effort to be more social and friendly and pay attention to other people and be human and shit, but I know what I am at my heart. I'm tired of performing.
