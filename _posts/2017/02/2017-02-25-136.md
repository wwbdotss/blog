Another example of the universe going full out against me. I felt hella good bringing home some pizza, and mom had enough appetite to eat a slice. Then later, because she ate the slice, she couldn't eat dinner. She tried to eat more, but was threatening to throw up. Of course it would happen this way, that the thing that makes me happy will actually be the worst thing that could happen. Because of the pizza, she would just end up throwing up everything and she would have been better off just eating some rice, which she could at least keep down. What the fuck is this shit.

Wrote a lot today, more than any other day for a long, long time. Feels good.

Want to make the font size big again. Feel like flexing. Need more space.
