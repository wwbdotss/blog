Alarm didn't wake me up today. It was inactive, but still turned on, so I have no idea.

Fixated on bitcoin and money and forecasts. I want big changes and I have latched on to bitcoin as my savior.

R cancelled lunch, not very surprised. Not that I mean anything by that; we were merely acquaintances, so I *was* surprised he actually contacted me in the first place.

There is a tiny splinter or something in the palm of my left hand. I can't see it but I feel it when I brush my hand against something.

Felt great exercising.

I'm in no mood to write, or even open the writing files. OK I'll just open them. Done! I'm glad this ploy works. I go to the files, and actually start working on it. Answered the questions for five chapters. Tidy.

More Youtube now. Looking forward to watching John Wick with E tomorrow.
