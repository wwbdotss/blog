Sleeping so late lately. Ravenously reading about 2008 thread on r/fi. I should cash out some stocks and build up my emergency fund. I don't feel any regret selling last month when stocks were rallying; any feeling of lost opportunity that I could have not sold then and sold now for more money isn't really in the picture. I'm more glad that the chunk I took out of my portfolio has been easily filled back in with the recent surge. I would have of course been happy if the stocks tanked immediately after I sold at the peak, but this supposed bad case doesn't feel bad at all.
