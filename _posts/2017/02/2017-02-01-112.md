A better day today because mom at least could sleep and is not in pain. She's dizzy from the painkillers.

Finished up some work at home. Felt productive. Did laundry, that felt nice. Did my push ups and sit ups. I could faintly see four packs coming in. Super faintly. Made V laugh, which was nice. So overall, a pretty good day. It doesn't take that much to make me feel ok. Just some relief from the incessant onslaught of misery would be nice.
