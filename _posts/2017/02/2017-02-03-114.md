I should not have eaten that bag of three-week old candied salmon jerky bits I forgot in the fridge. I really wonder if the universe will be straight with me with this and if my intuition matches up with reality. I think I will get violently food-poisoned in the middle of the night and maybe have to go to the emergency room. That's the worst case scenario and I don't want to be surprised when that happens. The likely thing is that I'll just wake up fine tomorrow morning. This is why we live life!

Do taxes tomorrow? Want to. Will see.

Nothing really else to look forward to. Work has been unsatisfactory and I'm not doing the best.
