John Wick was good. I liked the first one better. It was more cohesive and the motivation, though as simple as it gets, was more solid.

The walk down to the station was good. Really liked talking with E. I got the nice feeling of being with a friend. It's the feeling that I'm trying to convince myself that I don't need.

I'm going to need to send more money to buy more ether. After fees and the price increase lately, I'm still 50 short. More more more! And it'll be good to top off my bitcoins.

I'm not going to sleep at 11. Not as a routine, at least. I just want to stay up now. I can do my habits after dinner, whatever. It's not as bad after a while. It's better than not doing them. Waking up early enough is too hard and preventing me from doing anything. I don't want that excuse. I have the time in the evenings and I should just do what I need to do then. Opening up the writing file helps. It works.
