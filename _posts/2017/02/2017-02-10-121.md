Friday! The feeling is starting to come back. It was numb before, but weekends are starting to mean something again. I like staying up Friday nights and sleeping in. I will always, always like that. I should not mess this span of time up anymore. This is a good thing.

This is partially from me keeping up the distancing from the pain of seeing mom suffer. I can't handle it full on so I'm adding padding around my heart and accept that she's going to die soon. I can't do anything to help. I don't beat myself up over that.

What am I going to do tomorrow? Doesn't take much. Cafes. Forever.
