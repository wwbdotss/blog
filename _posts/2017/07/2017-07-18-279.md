Down because ETH went up then down again. EEA didn't do much to stop the slide. Because I didn't do something at work. Because mom is bedridden and just suffering day and night. Because I have to wait for fourth uncle to call about his schemes and I hate waiting for phone calls. Not writing hurts too. No forward process still. So I'm reminded that everything that is still wrong with my life is still here and I haven't done anything about them. I'm sleepy but I have to wait for the stupid phone call. I'm greasy feeling. Bad reddit message too. Every tiny thing that doesn't go my way has been rolled up and gained power to depress me.

Feel better now. Shower. Took call with uncle which I tried to be graceful in my saying no. ETH is up a bit. Nice lowkey interaction with dad. Listening without annoying wires headphones.
