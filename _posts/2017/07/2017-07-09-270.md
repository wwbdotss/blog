Saw Baby Driver. Eh. Ok. Not as fun or delightful as I expected. Lead actor with dumb expression.

Wandered around Japantown. It's an aimless destination for me now. I don't remember when I really had a real reason to go there for a while now.

Ran into Y and N at Starbucks. Coincidence. N said it was good to see that I was OK, after V abandoned me in the desert. I liked that. They probably said a lot of other stuff too to each other, but whatever. Objectively,  it's her bad.

I'll try to sleep earlier today. It's been 1:30, 2:00 a.m. to 11:30, noon kind of schedule this weekend.
