Last night. Hate it. I don't like change. I also don't want to stay here. I like the time spent doing whatever I want, but that could be anywhere, and in a casino in Vegas is not where I want to be. I don't want to go back to normal life because current normal life is pain. I don't want to go back to work. I don't want to pack up and get ready for the plane ride. I just don't want to do anything.

The last few days have just been in tatters and not worth remembering. I hate how I have to think about getting food all the time. Hunger drove my decisions and it's annoying as hell. Next time I travel, I'm bringing soylent. Fuck this shit.

ETH has been boring. John Hancock hasn't updated my balance and I'm tired of waiting to update my spreadsheet. That felt good for like five minutes then it's nothing again. The spike in net worth is due to imaginary internet money I can't depend on. It adds to the adrift feeling that's pervasive in my life.

I still have to pack my unwashed laundry into my small carry-on. That was a mistake. I should have just taken a bigger carry-on. The bag will probably burst. The timing is all wrong too. It's half past midnight already. Flight is in 14 hours. I have to get up earlier, which is messing the feeling right now. I hate feeling rushed and time running out. It's all time running out now.
