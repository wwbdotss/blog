H has been IMing me out of the blue. I haven't heard from her for like months and months, years?, and now the sudden activity. Not *that* much activity, just two initiated IMs, but I'm reading more into it of course. I still think every girl I interact with as a potential girlfriend and it's screwing with my mind and I probably can't behave normally.

The C Team is just so great!
