I have such crushes on Amy Falcone from the C Team and H from work. I can feel my emotional responses surging when I see and think about them. It's nuts how automatic and reflexive they are. As with all my crushes, they're tinged with sadness because I can't do anything about them. I felt the same way about H from A, E from the A, A from E; I think that's all. It's the same feeling I can recognize. It must be so great to be in real love and have that someone love you back and have love be an action I can participate in.
