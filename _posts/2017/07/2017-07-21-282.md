Mom's out of the hospital, at home now. Oxygen tank, lots of drugs, have to decide on the hospice, then insurance. I think that's the scope of everything to worry about.

Tired. All day at hospital trying to work from home. Terrible, I should have just taken the day off.

Parked at a four-hour area in a dead end street in a sea of one-hours. It was a nice find. Parked there the whole day and didn't get a ticket. That's one win.

Haven't looked at ETH. I'll look now and despair. Huh. It's not as bad as I thought. BTC hella jumped though. They might have successfully signaled for SegWit. 2x? I don't know.
