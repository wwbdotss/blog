Want to get back to writing.

Talk to Helen.

Getting bored with ETH.

Gym and working out for sure.

Don't want to depend at all on my job being there. It's fully in the luxury bucket now. I need to act as if I have already lost it. I don't know how I'm going to make money aside from the dream of passive income without working for someone. It wouldn't be bad if I really cared about the subject matter. I need to get myself a profession. Something I believe in, that matters, and I can put myself fully into. I don't care about web stuff and programming and developing and coding at all. I don't want to be a developer, and don't want to be in the tech industry. Maybe just not websites? Making apps might be more interesting. I don't like just making front-end presentational things. I want my work to do something. No more fucking marketing.
