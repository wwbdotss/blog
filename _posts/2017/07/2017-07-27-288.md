Mom has general discomfort on her body. I don't know how to alleviate that. She's already on morphine. There doesn't seem to be enough information to diagnose the problem. Helpless.

Didn't come back home to eat. Ate taco salad at small burrito place. It was ok. I won't get shrimp next time because that's expensive. Regular cheap chicken would have been good. Anything under $10 automatically makes me feel good about it.
