Another worst day of my life. Dad woke me up at 5 a.m. We need to get mom to the hospital. Called 911 and got an ambulance. Mom had trouble breathing and constipation. I thought it would be a pretty simple case of prescribing laxatives and we would return to the terrible norm punctuated with these fires. Dad said I should go to work after we were in the emergency room for a few hours. Mom is so emaciated and powerless to even move. I got back home via Lyft and merged back into my routine right on the dot. That felt really surreal, overlaying horror over mundane. I drifted through the day. I went to the hospital after going back home to pick up some vapor rub. I met red swollen eyes brimming with tears on both dad and V. Mom was deathly pale on the bed. What happened? The cancer had spread to her lungs. She also has a blood clot there. It was the worst case scenario for her shortness of breath. The extreme worst. I cried the same way I did two years ago when she was diagnosed. I was bowled over.

I felt relief from the proximity to closure here. But the massive sway is deep reflexive sorrow in the face of death. How could people live in the bounces between troughs of death? Everyone you know will die. It doesn't matter that I'm going to die. The worst part is watching other people die. Yet the world still runs despite what I just went through happening to millions of people every fucking day. The world still goes on. That's incredible.
