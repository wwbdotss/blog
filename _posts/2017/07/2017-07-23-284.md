T's baby shower. I could handle these social events in that I just basically ignore everyone that I don't know and just focus on having fun with my friends. Anyone else is extra. I'm not going to make it into a mission to make friends. Even though I should, it would ruin the mental affiliations I make between social events and stress of trying to convince strangers to like me. Instead, I treat the social event as a positive fun thing where I can take time to enjoy myself. That would make it easier for me to go to future social events. Like the wedding I'm dreading going, I can think more realistically and know that I'm just going to go there to eat, see, be seen, not going to try hard to do anything, just be cool and fucking chill. This sounds like the right path.

I hate not being able to raise my ratio.
