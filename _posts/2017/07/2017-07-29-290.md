Saw Dunkirk. Meh. IMAX sucks. The Punch Escrow was stupid. Returned for refund.

I don't know what to live for really. What I want--freedom--will never come until my parents die. And when that time comes, I will realize that that won't give me freedom anyway. I can't obtain it. I'm going to feel this way for the rest of my life. Furthermore, it'll get worse. I can't top my early twenties, when I had my own apartment and parents were fine and my job was fine and I had friends. Those were my golden years.

What is the first step for me to get out of this? The one biggest thing would be to make new friends and focus on people. I want to meet someone I can talk to. This takes the most effort and the least likely thing I would do. I feel like I have to wait until mom dies before I can do anything recuperative. Else, I would just be building on top of sand. It's useless and the depression of my mom suffering will undercut any attempts to improve and be happy. That is my biggest problem. I'm constantly on despair mode and I can't focus on anything.

How do I solve that but to wait until mom dies?
