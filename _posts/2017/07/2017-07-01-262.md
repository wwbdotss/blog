Didn't leave the hotel room. Napped twice. It was the weirdest thing. Ordered room service for breakfast, then ordered delivery for late dinner. So disoriented.

Tomorrow will pass so fast. It's 2:30 a.m. already, after hours of Heroes. I'll at least leave the room to get food. I'm tired of everything.
