Kate on Twitch is attractive, but I am not sure if it's the hair.

Dinner with E. It was good to talk.

I walked to Clement and that felt really great too. I saw where Sacramento ended on the western side. I'll walk one street north of that another day. I don't remember what the street name. It got really richy.

Should I sell the rest of my taxable account? I would enjoy the cash. I would top off my emergency fund, put aside some to cover taxes from all my selling I've done this year, put in a buffer for property tax too if my tax refund had eroded too much, and of course, buy more crypto!
