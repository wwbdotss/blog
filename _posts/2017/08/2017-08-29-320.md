ETH rising. So good. I started to rethink how I could make writing easier for myself. I don't value plot as much as I value presence in the moment of a story. Am I having a good time and engaged at that moment or is the author using pointers and references to promise a good time later on? I want to write *presently* and I think that would simplify things. I can let myself not lean so hard on a tight and coherent plot, the construction and proofing of which are stopping me from progressing. I don't want to deal with it. What's happening should preceed what's going to happen next. There is a balance, I should say. I'm just trying out this theory that it's all the planning and outlining that's blocking me from writing right now. Test it out, see if that's the case. Anything to get me back on the keyboard and trying again.

D is leaving. This sucks. Work will be less fun from now on. There is no one I want to eat lunch with. Except H. And N, I guess. I feel comfortable around her. Not friendly comfortable, but comfortable in that I think I know how she's like and I don't have to feel tense the entire time.
