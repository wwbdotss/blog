There is little that I feel now will make me happy. Only ETH. Money. I will only be happy if ETH reaches $10,000, that is how I feel now. Amazing how messed up this is. My diseased brain is trying to latch on to whatever sad thing is around after the reliable well that is mom's cancer is no longer available as a bountiful source. It's so easy to hate on everything and give in to the indifference and despair. I don't care, is all it is.

Watched some of The Defiant Ones and stopped because I didn't care about people in music. Watched more Kate, which relaxes me. Crypto charts, more mindless, desperate comfort. Bank accounts. I gravitate toward those senses of security, and avoid and try to get away from sources of danger and uncertainty like people. I don't know where I stand anymore anywhere. It's a weird time.

I can't gain weight and am even losing weight. I'm not eating enough obviously or I may have some disease eating away inside me. First aunt doesn't cook enough food during dinner, that's just my perception, and the food isn't as good as mom's, so I have been eating only one bowl of rice lately, and the whole situation is not good at all. I try to plug in the holes with soylent but it hasn't done enough, if anything.

I'm only carrying on in the belief that this will pass and I'll get some respite then dive back in and back up, over and over again.
