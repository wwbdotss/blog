I read back some of the older entries of this blog and they were unreadable. Carefree writing makes me seem illiterate. It was hard reading about mom too as she declined.

Today she seemed mentally affected too. She was really weak and it was hard to understand her. She had trouble speaking and articulating. Worse and worse and worse.

I modified the money spreadsheet to pull out the crypto in its own column. I think the best has already happened and it's a slow bleed from here. Good things may happen again in a couple of years.
