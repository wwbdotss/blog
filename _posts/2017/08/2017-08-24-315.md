Someone smashed into my parked car hard enough to move it halfway up on the curb. This is getting hilarious. My life. The trunk was also open and the driver side window was broken so looks like someone also broke into it? I'm really curious what the order of events was. Both at the same time!

I don't want to think about buying a new car for a long time. I haven't even bought a new phone yet.

Dinner with H was unremarkable and uninspired like the crab noodle soup. There was nothing. Glad I did it though. Good to have someone to eat with.
