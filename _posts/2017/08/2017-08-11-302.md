The fewer fucks I give, the happier I am. Crypto has made me not care about more things. Writing is no longer that urgent. I care even less about my job. I believe in it so much that I feel my future is more secure, which goes a long way to relieving my mental burden. It also allows me to give fewer fucks. I'm becoming the true cynical, pessimistic, indifferent, anti-social, detached loner I'm destined to be. Which makes me really happy.

It's such a relief not to have to worry about mom anymore. I feel like a new person. I feel optimistic and motivated again to do things. I can't wait to unpack the crap behind me. I want to get my PC and monitor up. Work out more. Ask H out. Life seems more leavened.

After I get through this weekend, I will feel better than I have felt in two years.
