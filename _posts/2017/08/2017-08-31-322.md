Going to not look at crypto for the entire month. I'm going to do it!

Instead, I'll work on my book. Hopefully write, but it'll probably be slacking off planning and worldbuilding and outlining. I'm never going to be a working author. No time constraints. Hobby for sure.

Made the doctor's appointment. I need to see if the growth on my chest is a tumor. The mole on my back too. And get some acme medication for my face. And a regular check up. Those are the things I want out of this visit.
