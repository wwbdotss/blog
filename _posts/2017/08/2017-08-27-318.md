Felt better today after blogging. And gym was good. Blaze pizza. Talked with dad about Tesla. That was big reliefer in removing the potential car conflict off my list of things to worry about. Game of Thrones season finale. ETH almost reached 350 again, but fell when I checked again. Oh well. Sleep now.
