I'm in this lull of time, immediately after mom died, when I'm just trying to settle back up to baseline from before the two unrelenting years of depression and despair. I haven't done anything since she died. Just kind of floated, shellshocked, feeling out what's normal and constantly reminded of the lesser weight and burden off my chest and shoulders.

The stupid car's ruining the expanse of peace, so fuck that. I don't even care what happens to it now. Even if the city tows it, it's the worst that could happen and has happened, so no, it shall not have power over me.

What's tomorrow? More reddit at work, more eth, more streaming when I come home, more normality.

When will I start writing again? I could finish unpacking. Progress again. I don't know when.

Bought cereal, which is cool.
