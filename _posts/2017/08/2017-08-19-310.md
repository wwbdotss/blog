Very important: I put the surge protector power strip up off the floor and mounted it on the wall. I feel more secure using it. No more bending awkwardly to the floor every time. I don't have to die a little inside every time I drop a cable. Took much longer than it seemed to find the right screws and screwdriver. Made do. Glorious.

Gym, and mall with V. Asked H to dinner next week. I don't know what I'm doing.

Listless. I teared up at first when I saw a line item on my spreadsheet about getting ramen with mom in May. I have to move that away from the front of the notes section so I don't cry every time I scroll through.
