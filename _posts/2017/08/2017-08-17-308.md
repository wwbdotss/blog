Not sure what I'm waiting for. Got eclipse glasses from V. Dinner with E tmr. Helped dad with IHSS video. Posted thread about how eth changed your life. I immediately regretted posting because I think it's lame. It's a failure if it doesn't get a lot of comments. That's my only criteria, which is unreasonable. I don't want to keep watching Kate stream because it's really a lot of time devoted to something I don't care that much about, but I have nothing to do with the time, so I'm filling it with non-offensive stuff.

I have I Follow Rivers on repeat. It's become the song of this period for me.
