Going to stop playing Civ now. I got that out of my system. Maybe. I was watching Kate stream at the same time, so that could have messed with my  enjoyment.

Nothing to do at work. I super am going to take Friday off though. I can avoid having to interview someone with J in the same room, avoid the stressful debriefing when people judge all over the place, the BBQ, which would involve a lot of people hanging around, and generally avoid the usual tatters of Friday when nothing gets done. Feel so good giving that a big miss. I'll hang out in Japantown oh yes. It'll be a nice bridge between birthday dinner with C and trip down to the south bay with E on Saturday. Best use of PTO ever.

Sleeping at 1 again. Eh.
