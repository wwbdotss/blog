Set up the PC, spent the whole day, I'm tired. It didn't really make me feel that great. It's good I guess, but it brings back weird memories from two years ago. And anything to do with the past reminds me of mom. The last time I used the PC I was still in my apartment too, so it's double bad memories. The high resolution is hard to read comfortably; I'll have to zoom in all the time. I have no reason to buy any more computer stuff. The graphics card and the monitor are *fine*; resist temptations.

I don't know what I would do with the PC. Gaming and video watching I guess. I've closed the loop on the keyboard and to be honest it's less functional than the standard wireless Microsoft keyboard. The keys are too loud to use at night. I've replaced all the blank keycaps, so now it just looks super ordinary. There's nothing to it. Relearning Windows keyboard shortcuts is going to be messy.

Dim sum with dad, V, first aunt, and grandma at King Wah. It was good. The food was tasty. Good solid experience.
