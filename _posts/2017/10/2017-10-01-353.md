Selling my brokerage account. I don't think I will regret it. Moving money around is fun. I want to buy more things for myself. Buy all the things.

Slept late last night and woke up early. Went back to sleep in a daze. Woke up next past noon feeling disgusting.

Cleaned a corner of the room. Feels good. Vacuum brushed the dust away. Cleaned up the PC. Threw the second batch of clothes and the broken Blu-Ray player into a trash bag. Schlepped that thing to the Goodwill. Skipped gym because of that. Got lemonade which was too sweet and threw it away after a few sips. Should have mentioned that to the cashier. Flipped through Popular Photograpy and Scientific American. Walked back unburdened. Couldn't decide what I wanted to eat or if I should even buy something, could just go home and let soylent solve the problem. Was all set to go to Lakeshore, then thought better of it. Went into the pizza place close by for the first time after all these years. Got a slice to go. Pepperoni and mushroom. Not that great. Too thick and flour-y. I ate it in the parklet, which was pretty nice. I was super hungry and tired and hot at that point. I was wholly under the biological directives.

Tired now. Sleepy. Still early. Turned off Kate stream. Not going to get an instagram account. I will probably not write. I need to maintain personal relations.

What's next? The 9/30 box has closed. What's the way forward? New dreads. New to do lists.
