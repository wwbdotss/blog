Watched Blade Runner. I liked it.

Itchy ass bite on my wrist. I fucking hate itches and by extension mosquitos. I can't do anything about it but endure the itch. It was when I was waiting for the bus or something. Went down to Sunnyvale. Lots of wasted time on the dumb bus. Annoyed that grandma worried about me coming home late and bothered V to call me. Annoyed that ETH is down and that the Warriors lost. Both are annoying to follow and I can't keep hitching up my emotions to those events that I can't control. I'm so agitated. Not in a good mood. All four of these things are stupid and insignificant, but the multiplier of dad being gone and my general background malaise and not finding meaning in things continuously piss me off.

Wifi adapter came and now I have fast internet on the desktop, yes! That's something good. I need more good things.

What happens now? What am I going to do with Tuesday now over. I have to face whatever is coming up without any excuses at all.
