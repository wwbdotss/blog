Dinner with dad, first aunt, and grandma at Jumbo for my birthday. V got leftovers.

Moving money around.

Stayed up til 2 last night and really paid for it this morning. Didn't even realize how much snoozing I did.

Watched Kate stream some more. I'm going to do a Starbucks night tomorrow. I still don't know what to eat around West Portal.
