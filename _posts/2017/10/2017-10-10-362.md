Don't want to psychoanalyze today.

Really hard to get up today. Lingered. Should have gotten off Van Ness but didn't for some reason. There was a moment there. I deliberately didn't check the time and wanted to stay put and fuck what I should do. That cost me. I stayed on the train, which crawled between the stops at the end of the line. I also got off one stop too early and had to get back on. I caught the 1 at 10 for fuck's sake. I made it though. I ran through the lung searing burnt air from the wildfires up north. Stand-up was just starting. I felt great.

I need to ween myself off Kate's streams. I can feel the biological effects in my brain. It's the same craving I get from anticipating playing games back in college, or watching Youtube more recently, and crypto, or any of the time wasting things I obsessed about to put off writing and constructive and helpful things I can do to improve my life. It's old news.

I don't want to read Sylvia Plath's novels. Just her poems please.

I drew out the boxes for the next week or so. I feel really tangled and unfocused. The meeting tomorrow is really bothering me because I'm working with the other office and it's like starting a new job with new people I've never worked with before. It's the unknown, as always.
