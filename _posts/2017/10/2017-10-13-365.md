Nothing real to worry about since I got the approval for the tech test. It's so insignificant and miniscule but there it is.

I want the Google Chromebook, the old one, because it's boxy and simple. That's the only reason. What if I just get it? Would I hate myself? It is like $550 dollars. I want it to see what it's like. Hm. Will it make me happy? For like 5 seconds. Then I would realize it's just the internet again and the writing I think I'm going to use it for won't really happen because it's not happening now either. I will not buy it. It should be an easy final.

Stayed until the end of happy hour for C's last day. There is nothing to be afraid of. It's just people talking.

Oh, one year!
