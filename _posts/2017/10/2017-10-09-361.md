What am I doing.

I have no direction. I have no magnitude.

Listening to music from the site Arctic Drones. Drinking soylent because I hardly ate anything at dinner. First aunt doesn't cook enough sometimes and I leave the table unsatiated. Not hungry, per se. Not fulfilled. I'm leaning hard on soylent.

Worried about a lot of things.

Dad going to China for two months. Lots of bad things can and will happen. If something goes wrong for him there, how do I go help? Things go wrong at home, with grandma, with water heater, anything, I wouldn't know what to do.

Dad's jury duty, have to call them to get a definitive answer on what to do.

I always feel vulnerable at work and everything feels so fragile. My whole work history is so fragile. Everything can fall apart so easily. I won't be able to help. I don't feel in control of my life and things just keep happening to me. I don't act and go forward because I'm so relieved and happy to just stand still and be on par and not be in pain. Avoiding pain is my whole motivation at this point.

This is a down day for sure. I'm looking for reasons to be sad. It's depression for sure.
