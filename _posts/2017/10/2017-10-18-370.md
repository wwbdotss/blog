Dinner for second uncle's birthday. At first, I hated having to go. Then during and after, I realized it was alright and it was good that I had gone. My earlier self was totally wrong. I might have known too that I was wrong then, but my emotions took over and I didn't have the best judgement about what was in my best interest. It's a stark, real case of my failing and I need to remember this when this undoubtedly comes up again. Recognition of the problem is a first step.

All my aunts took a picture with grandma and it was a really good moment.

I felt pretty great all night after that. People are important. I made an effort to chat with V a bit when she came back for dinner.

I pared down some chuff from the PC. Then I sorted out my to-do list and I feel much better about it. I love this feeling. Minimalism definitely makes me feel good. I love getting rid of excess and get joy from uncomplicating and paring down and simplifying and deleting and reducing. All the stuff falling to the wayside is stuff I don't have to mentally keep track of anymore. It's freedom and control.

Now how can I get myself to write and to socialize.

It also feels great to interact with L, even if super marginally through a few Twitter messages. Any connection is a good connection. I need to visit her.
