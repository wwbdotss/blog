Really good thing to happen: I found a favorite dish from King of Thai! I can now have an alternative to the duck noodle soup and duck fried rice. I didn't realize before that I could add noodles to the soup part of the menu. The spicy shrimp and mushroom soup with tomatoes is the best. I have that corner of life sorted out. King of Thai is definitely my go-to place now. I got off at West Portal hungry and couldn't get into Squat and Gobble because of the horde of kids and parents. Repulsion swept through every cell in my body. I hate, hate everything about it. The group there just seemed to stand around in front of an empty counter. I have no idea what was happening.  I needed to run away. The Chinese restaurant around the corner that I would have tried just happened to be closed on Tuesday. I hurried to an off street to avoid the crowd. Of course, that's where most of the kids are! I walked on the road because the sidewalks were choked with them. It was the rich part of the area too so it was even more blindingly obvious I shouldn't have walked in that direction. I made it out alive eventually.

I can probably get to the bottom of why I hate kids and families and rich people and holidays and crowds so much, but whatever the reason, I know what I felt and it was definitive. I can take that data point to the fucking bank. I don't know much for certain about myself, but I know *that*.
