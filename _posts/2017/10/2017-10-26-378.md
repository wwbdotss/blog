Even more Civ. It's 2 a.m. again. Fuck.

Slept past the alarm and woke up at 10 today. Whoops. Lied about a plumbing problem and got to work at 11 something. Thank goodness that work's so relaxed and there's nothing to do.

Hot pot with C and E. It was great. Just like most other times with them. I felt like myself and I was in control and could express myself and represent myself well. My world would be completely different if I felt like that when I talk and interact with people in general. If only that were my baseline. Caught a glimpse of the possible.

Lied about tomorrow to get PTO and WFH. Whatever.
