Depressed because the plumbing problem lingers and stretches and won't close. It has to just go away.

Gym today, which was good. Dropped my Jamba Juice, sad.

It felt good to tell V about all the problems from yesterday. I'm overblowing them. They're pieces of the general crap I live with, the everyday problems of communicating, which really is the problem of my life. It's the ultimate sentient problem.

I just want to sleep now and not think of anything. I have nothing really to look forward to in the immediate future. I booked my solo hotel, which is going to be nice. Bungy jumping booked too. I just have to fill in all the other crap in between. NZ feels like it's in the bag.

I'm just here waiting for my mind to be arbitrarily not depressed again so it doesn't magnify all my problems and I can not be fucking paralyzed.

I need to make that depression appointment with the doctor and get that into contact with the real world.

And why the fuck aren't I writing. I can't do it.
