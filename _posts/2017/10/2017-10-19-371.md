Lots of crap coming up just as dad is out. This is how it works. Fucking great. Tenants asking for a buttload of fixes. Second aunt has caretaker questions. The roof is leaking. Crap upon crap. These aren't super terrible things, but are in aggregate.

Installed buttloads of games to distract myself. I'm never going to be a writer.

It's 1 something now too. I'll wake up exhausted tomorrow to start off another day.

D did ask me to watch Thor with G. It's more things on my mind.

Exchange wouldn't let me send out ETH either what the fuck.
