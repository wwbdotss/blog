What's kept me up tonight? Crypto and nba.

Split buys on btc and eth. Feel pretty good about it.

Walked to Golden Gate Park and sat on a bench. Went to the library for the rest of the day. That's my day off. Beh.

Cemetery tomorrow. Anxious as hell about the plumber. Hate mushy communication so much. It would be so much better for me to have called my own plumber instead of depending on dad and second uncle setting things up. It's roundabout as hell. The plumber would have to go through second uncle then to me to talk to the tenants then back to dad for payment and shit? Fuck that noise. Never again.

I just want the morning to be over and be on my way to Palo Alto with E to get my glasses and bun bo hue.
