Crypto is eye-popping. Happened twice today, for BTC and ETH. Good stuff. I love going with my gut and having it work out. Nothing like it. I had my finger on the trigger and, what the hell, pushed. Doesn't matter what happens tomorrow. I still want to buy more BTC, but not now. More gut going.

Dinner with E at ex-Naan and Curry place. Really good.

Sent out tech test late at night. Feels good? I don't have to worry about rushing tomorrow morning. Bought myself a little bit of time. The perfect scenario would be to have the approval on my desk when I get in.

I want to have dim sum with dad before he leaves. I'm going to make that happen.

The check came in from the FSA. Closing that loop tomorrow. Will feel good.
