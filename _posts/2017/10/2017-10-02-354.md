I don't give a fuck about the Las Vegas shooting. Like I didn't give a fuck about the hurricanes. Or whatever disaster blazes across the headlines next. It's people pointing look over here and my reflex to not, no, I won't.

I'm going to stop watching Kate's streams or any streams and cut off all the hours I'm shoveling over there. My problem I guess has always been a time problem. Time really is the enemy.

I'm going to put in the queue deposit for the Model 3 but I don't know if I want to buy it. Good thing I have two years before that decision will come up.

I've pretty much just heaped all the work on V to resolve the title transfers. Nothing about houses are simple when it should be the simplest primary thing.

Just feeling bad all around, mildly, as it tends. Work is uncertain and fuzzy, and I don't have full confidence in L to manage things well. Beh.

Tomorrow will be better because I'll have time to do stuff that I saved from not watching Kate stream.

I have to wait until end of the week for any fun money transfer fun.

One step in front of the other.
