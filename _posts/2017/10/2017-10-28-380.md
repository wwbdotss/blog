I'm exhausting all my distractions. The only thing left is writing. I don't want to play games anymore. That bout is over. They are meaningless. I've bought my last crypto. The discussions are the same boring delusions. Wake me up when something actually happens. I want to recreate the excitement I felt in May. That will involve not following the news for half the year. And also another once in a lifetime event. That was so fucking lucky.

Went down to Palo Alto with E and got my glasses at last. I'm pretty indifferent to them. They look different but I don't want to wear them for close work because it's unnecessary. My eyes haven't gotten that much worse. I'll ease them in eventually.

Cemetery visit was long and a chore. It ended on time at least.

How hard is it to make a freaking plumbing appointment. Communication is the ultimate task. The motherfucker better show up on Monday at 5.

I just want sleep.
