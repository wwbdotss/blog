House title stuff done and done. Feels good. So glad that went smoothly for V and dad at city hall today.

Didn't watch any Kate streams today. Feels good too. Self-control.

Wrote an effective email at work to address feedback. Good.

My open loops are closing nicely. I like having a dread list and a looking forward to list. I will tweak my lists later. I've defaulted back to one big list of to dos ranked in order of importance?

I fleshed out the book 1 outlines last night, so still feel pretty clean and good about it today. Carry over.

I could feel my brain ranging and sweeping out feelers to grasp at whatever incoming bad thing to worry about. It's sick.

What am I going to do tomorrow? Just be.
