If only I can treat writing as I do journaling. This is effortless and self-sustaining. Writing is the absolute opposite. It's totally on the wrong side of the entropy.

I'll try to wake up earlier tomorrow. That's a nice goal with real immediate benefits to how I feel. I'll try to wake up before 8. That'll be really awesome.

I want to go back to making sure I do one new thing a day. It's a good habit to form. What did I do today? I got a new salad from Squat and Gobble, the Mexican Chicken. It wasn't as filling as I feared it would be, so that was good. The sour tart dressing helped a lot with that perception.

Tomorrow dinner for E's birthday, that'll be good. Looking forward to it. Work dread has subsided because it never survives contact. Reality has always been better than my fears. I never learn though, and my brain never learns. The DB email meeting was fine. The regular store emails could still blow up, but oh well, what could I really do. Just push it through. Hopefully H will fill in and not K.

Worked on the book even though I didn't want to and of course of course once I started it was a lot easier and I liked it. I'll just keep doing this to myself. Initiate, initiate.

Hate waiting for money to deposit on the exchange. Taking forever.
