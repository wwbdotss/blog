Feels great not to care.

Gym with V, good. Boudin's soups are hella salty. Reading The Taking of K-129, ok so far. Skipping random details. Don't care about the people. I want to know what happened.

Reserved Model 3. Indifferent. Hate that my credit card bill will be higher.

Feels good to comment on Reddit with no regard to replies.

Resisting watching Kate streams for no obvious reason. I'm not doing anything else productive. Not really? I'm just diverting my attention to somewhat less obsessive behavior, like reading the K-129 book and random, equally ineffectual things I fill my to do list with.

I really need to buy more food and snacks to eat.

I have a lot of figure out with dad going on vacation and my vacation. I'm in no mood to plan.

What do I want? To watch Kate stream tomorrow lol. I'm so lost.
