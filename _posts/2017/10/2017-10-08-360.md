Arsicault for chocolate croissant. Juice from street market. I wasn't hungry enough to get salad from Danube and I wanted the internet to watch Kate streams.

Waiting for the library to open is a really bad feeling. Re-watched her 6-win stream.

Got KFC for dad.

Watched more stream. Read K-129. Almost finished, but it's super late now. I'm hella disappointed they only fished like a third of the sub out. All that for pretty much nothing. What a downer.
