Day eight. The few seconds as I shuffled toward the edge of the plank with my feet all tied for the bungy jump were the most vividly physically scary since, well, a few days ago when I jumped into the cave water with the tube. I wish I could have lingered and savored the intensity. Screw seeming like I'm scared if I held things up; that moment was the best thing ever. The Buddhism thing is injecting itself into my life more and more. I like looking at feelings like specimens.

Ate at Indian place. Another overpriced and excessive meal.

Napped for a bad hour or so. Then indulged in offtime and didn't leave the room the rest of the day, like I knew would happen.

Ate cheese, crackers, tomato, some carrots, cutie, and pizza K brought back.

Tethered because room had a stupid daily one gig limit. Streamed Kate for 600 megs. Watching more now, at 2:30 a.m.

Wanaka tomorrow. Dread driving.
