Day eleven. Last full day. Not very substantial. Went to the luge back in Queenstown. It and the gondola ride were just ok. Finally ate at the Korean place. It was light. Bought groceries and souvenirs. Went to Arrowtown. Excessive dinner. Back at cottages, short night because of the early flight the next day. And that was that for NZ.
