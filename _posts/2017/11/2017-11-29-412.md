Day ten. Woke up early for hike. The hike was good but not that good to be worth the three hour drive and stay at weird Twizel. It's not efficient at all. I'm going with it. Staying in cottage now outside of Queenstown. Watched 1974 version of Murder on the Orient Express, which is really good! The story is great and makes sense and ties together and could only be this way.

Crypto down. Insane volatility plz.
