Vacation begins. I'm slightly positive.

Nice and wrapped up work. Solved a problem with absolute links and non-working jQuery slider. That was just relief for the rest of the day.

Ate leftovers from last week, the gumbo, KFC mac and cheese, and the non-moldy half of a chocolate beignet.

No stream today so no writing.

I need to get my haircut and what else? Looking forward to the long plane ride.
