I won't relax until dad gets back. Fucking sucks. Everything is a ticking time bomb.

Walked to Enchante. Used Caviar to buy too much food. Prime rib tomorrow with R and G. Not really looking forward to it because a plain nothing day would be nice.

Every little thing that happens to grandma is setting me off. I'm on constant high alert, just like with mom. It could be that I'm on high alert no matter what; my roving brain will latch on to whatever imperfection and obsess and worry about it. FML.

BCH and BTC going crazy.
