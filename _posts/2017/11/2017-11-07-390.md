Got take-out for V's birthday dinner. Grandma didn't want to go out.

She got a Chromebook.

Watching more streams.

The pattern has been the same for the last couple of days. Wake up late with not enough sleep. Do nothing, Reddit at work, crypto and nba, expensive salads for lunch, stream at night til late. Uhhhhh.
