A pretty good day. ETH is up. Wrote. Dim sum with grandma and first aunt. Gym.

The streaming while writing thing is working like a charm. I'm building and deciding what the bones of the story are. I really need a style for more than two tiers of headers.

I need to shave my head tomorrow. Pack. That's all. I haven't really decided what I would do on the plane. Write? That'll be ideal. Read Oathbringer. Watch Stranger Things 2. Heroes? No probably not. Or maybe! I'm going to really enjoy the next few days. The ride is even better because I'm landing alone and can do whatever.
