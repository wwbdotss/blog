Getting ready for bed at 11 should really help improve my life. When I was brushing my teeth at first, I don't feel the panic of feeling like I'm racing against the clock to get to bed before it gets too late. Instead, I kept bumping up against the nice fact that I have a buffer and I don't have to panic. Nice. I want to extend that to the morning too. That's the plan anyway. I'll set the alarm for 7:30 and keep it there. I know I'll snooze; that probably won't ever go away. I just hope I can get tired of snoozing and get up at 8. Over time, I hope me going to bed earlier would make snoozing for an hour less and less likely.

I liked today's cold turkey experiment. I didn't watch streams. I didn't go on reddit at all. I feel good. I worked on my money worksheet, which will hopefully morph into writing for that block of time. I got work done at work. It's all good. Plus, it builds up anticipation of tomorow when I can browse mindlessly all the accumulated content I want. I want to make a bad day of the week Cold Turkey Day forever. Can I designate Sunday? Perhaps Monday. Definitely not Friday or Saturday. I could have two Cold Turkey Days. I think that'll be swell. I really want this to work out.

I still need to remind myself to do one new thing a day. I think that's a super good habit to do as well.
