I am writing this just so I can mash the buttons of the keyboard. This feels great!

Sunday mornings with grandma. First aunt takes her break and I have no idea where she goes. I think she goes back home. I bought salmon fried rice, wonton noodle soup, and turnip cakes for grandma. It's a matter of just giving her the food instead of asking. And it works.

I will never accept that I have to be somewhere at some time. I want to get rid of all traces of that from my life. It is not ok, and I need that aspect of life gone.

Just back from watching Thor with D and G and his wife and it was as expected. No surprises. I'm still pretty awful at making chitchat.
