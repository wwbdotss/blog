Seems more and more that writing is the only thing I can feel good about. Everything else is not dependable.

Crypto has large spikes but pretty much a pointlessness as a baseline. There is nothing really good to feel about it at its core. 

People are supposed to be this amazing thing and love and family and all that. It's not. It's the source of most of my pain. I'm not convinced it's worth the lauded benefits. I'm losing all my friends, and family just stresses and depresses me.

Money is stupid and I need to stop.

Travel doesn't do it. It needs to be less of a chore.

I'm not disciplined enough for the gym.

Games are stupid and an ultimate waste of time. I have to make myself play and enjoy.

Work has no meaning. I haven't found my profession. 

Except writing. That is pure and good through and through. I don't have any reservations about it, or anything to snag on when I think about it. No cons.

I *am* super looking forward to the spicy shrimp noodle soup. Waiting to get hungrier. Or just hungry.
