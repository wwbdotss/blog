I wrote while I watched Kate stream. It's amazing. That combination has everything in it for me to finish the book. All the incentives and mindset and motivations are right there coexisting perfectly. I'm doing this every day anyway. In fact, writing while watching the stream improves the stream because it removes the guilt from it, PLUS, it lets me take advantage of instead of wasting the downtime during the stream. And anything that gets me writing is a plus. So even the little moments and snatches of words of I slip in during the stream are each 100% improvement over the zero work I would otherwise put into the book while waiting to work up the motivation to write.

I'm on the cusp of destiny! This could be what saves me. I don't care if it turns out not because it feels so right and hopeful right now. Love it.

Also, thought of a nice project at work to overlay percentages on screenshots. Seems so possible.

Downloaded second season of Stranger Things to watch on the plane.

It rained this afternoon, which was awesome. Favorite season is in full bloom.

The UPS came. I feel so safe now and want the power to flicker. I love immunity.
