Day nine. Fell asleep before blogging.

Driving on the left was weird but I've gotten more used to it. Got the Wanaka tree picture. Wanaka is a nice town. Ate at Big Fig. Something fig. Drove to Mt. Iron for the hike. 1.5 hours round trip. It was exhausting. Steep and hot. The view was kind of ok. After that drove far to middle of nowhere town in the rain. Twizel. Got some maybe nice pictures along the way. Thai food in super small town. Then visited this lake in the twilight. There was a dead fish by the shore. Gnats and bugs in clouds. A dark forest close to the shore. The area felt strange. The lake was nice nevertheless. All lakes and mountains in New Zealand are nice it turns out. Everything got kind of wet. I just showered and brushed my teeth and went to bed at like 9:30.
