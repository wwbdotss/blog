Day three. Best day so far. Went to Waiheke Island and hiked around. Vivid scenery. Nice small beach town. I felt nice and effortful, so I got to enjoy the offtime. K will be here tomorrow, so something new. I'm glad to have company, I think. I don't think I can be alone here anymore. So sleepy. I didn't nap today. Not for long, anyway. I bounded out of bed for Kate's stream. It was short unfortunately, but still ok. I kept on eating today. I didn't know what to do but eat.
