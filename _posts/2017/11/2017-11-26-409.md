Landscapes and nature re-energize me. When I got out of the plane and looked over and saw the green mountains surrounding Queenstown, I felt a second life surge through me. I was super tired of the trip at that point and wanted things to end. Then it all flipped around so quickly. K and I walked around the town and I couldn't wait to explore the area. Everything is wonderful.
