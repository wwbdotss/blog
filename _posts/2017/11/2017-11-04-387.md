Now I'm worried because I don't see the rent check from the tenants yet. That is at the top of my concerns. If I don't see it by tomorrow, it would mean I have to ask them for it. Any human interaction puts me on alert and unease.

Watched Louis's flight around the world episode in Pakistan and I get struck by how awesome the world is and how much there is to it. There are so many things I have no clue about, and how people live, and there's so much to take in. It makes me feel small, not in a really bad way either.

Greatest thing I did today was to write for a few hours at the cafe. It was the most time I spent on the book in a long while. It still wasn't much, but I got some things nailed down enough to feel that the events are cohesive and I can keep going. That is by far the most important part--I need to feel all the events all line up properly and there's a continuity and I don't have to double back and fill in any major structural gaps. I need to feel I'm on steady, solid ground before I can make any further steps. It's pretty good right now.

Watching Thor tomorrow with D and G. That'll be different. I can sort of see how it'll turn out. Glad it's happening and to be invited.

R and G's holiday party. I don't care about half the people there. It's just going through the motions with them. I guess it's harder to like everyone in the room enough? I wish it could be that way.
