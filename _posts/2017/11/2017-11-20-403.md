First night in Auckland. It's just a city. I haven't seen anything interesting. The mix of people here is interesting. Maori, white, Indian, Asian people. I haven't seen any Mexicans or black people. I'm disoriented by the left side driving and not sure if people walk this way on the sidewalks too. Out of sorts for sure. Big dose of I don't belong here. It doesn't help that my sleeping schedule is kind of knocked around. I might have napped but it was in fits. It was either too hot or too cold and I was worried about the weird ass growth tumor thing on my chest.

I don't like the hotel. It has a fucking minibar. Only 24 hours of free wifi, what the fuck. No fridge or microwave. Well, there is a fridge, but it's the mini bar fridge that I've actually filled with more food that I want to keep cold. I don't even know if it actually keeps things cold. Might just be a box with a blue light. It does have a electric kettle. So awesome. I can have my porridge oats and instant ramen.

I really want to not go outside tomorrow. I can make that happen. I can follow my whims completely. It would be easy to just take a boat ride too, no fuss. Not care if it's the optimal choice and just go with it. I'm curious about the whale tour too.
