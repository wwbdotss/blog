Second day in NZ. Waking up nice and early naturally at 8. That won't last. It's 1 now already. I'm made to stay up. Good breakfast watching Kate stream. Wrote tiny bit during. After that, it was still just 11. Went out with the Sky Tower in mind. Walked around and bought crap. Too many snacks and piecemeal food. I'm only eating Asian stuff. Found sad Japanese dollar store in the basement, and an nearly empty Japanese grocer with stale Pocky. Wandered around small park, which was ok. Sky Tower is just like any other tall building with the same kind of city view up top. Not worth it. I paid for a return trip at night, but kind of knew I wouldn't leave the hotel room once I got back. It turned out exactly that. I came back and again, my room was not ready. They were dealing with electrical stuff, which they didn't fix. The lamps are still just for decoration and couldn't turn on. The fan doesn't do anything either. Auckland so far has been super generic. I need to go on a boat tomorrow to save the time I'm spending here with something memorable, but I hate having to do anything on vacation, when I should be doing what I want. That's what's warring inside me now.

I'll end up doing it.

Checked crypto, don't care. Thing's are up.
