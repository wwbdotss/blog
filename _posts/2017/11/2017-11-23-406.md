Day four. Really eventful. Kevin arrived. Ate at really good oyster place with seafood soup that's not too salty. Airbnb with a cat. Walked around two distinct districts; one's kind of galleryish with nice boutiques but also down-to-earth restaurants, no real pretention. Ate sushi. The other street is full of cheap Asian restaurants with a food court, and eclectic shops. Hemp store. Rolled ice cream shop. Strip club and adult stores. It was very, very good. Went into an old Asian-themed bar with antique furniture and low red lighting. Ordered Bloody Mary. K dissed me wanting to pick up trash at the beach as a volunteering activity, making fun of Stranger Things too in the same sentence. His meanness shows up. I don't know how to react like always. Walked back, then found another nice stretch of stores with good selections of food. Ramen. Pies. Board game cafe with cake. I could totally live here. Then the grand finale. We went into a dim sum place that is also a bar with a karoke stage, a slot machine room, and a barbecue grill out back past the pool table. I wish I had ordered dim sum but didn't want to keep eating. Sang on stage, very glad I did to have the memory. The locals are really good. I then threw $2 away by gambling.
