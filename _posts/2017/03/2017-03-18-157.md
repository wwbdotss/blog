Forgot to post this, first time. Eh.

Ran a lap in the polo fields. There was a stretch when Everlasting Light kicked in that I spurted forward and it was the best.

Enchante for a few hours. Large decaf. I didn't eat very well at all that day. I had some soylent, a banana, small chicken salad in a box, bag of chips, bad seafood noodles, bad frozen yogurt, and three cuties. That is not going to get me muscles.

I couldn't keep my energy up and laid down in the car for several hours. I couldn't nap. I didn't fall asleep, I'm sure, just drifted.
