A nothing day at work where I didn't do anything but read kboards. I'm still not writing enough. I'm doing all the ancillary busy excuse work and none of the actual writing.

Nose is itchy and annoying. Allergies still hanging steady.

Tomorrow, Logan. Then dad's birthday dinner. Then R and G lunch/dinner. Then dad's birthday dinner again, with relatives. I was supposed to have super PTO Friday all to myself, but oh well. I will still have the entire day. I would probably spend it all watching and finishing off Ben Brown videos. Then I will fill this time with reading. And writing.

Good day today because mom was alert and cooking and eating. Feels good.
