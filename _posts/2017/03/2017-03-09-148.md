Watched Logan with D. It was OK. They did the crying scene well and I got misty-eyed, thinking about family dying and how seeing other people cry really gets me emotional. So the beats were there. It wasted good opportunities. It could have been really great. They shouldn't have had the clone there. He needed more opportunities to really protect the kid, in more poignant ways. That part didn't hit home enough. B/B-.

PTO tomorrow. Still don't really know what to do or where to go. I want to eat katsu curry. Perhaps. Caesar salad please.
