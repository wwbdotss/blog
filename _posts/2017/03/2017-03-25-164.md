Worked at Enchante. Tired. Big decaf, blueberry pastry, listened to Drake. Volcano Curry, chicken katsu with potato croquette. Napped in car with Acq Inc C Team podcast on and dozing in and out so I couldn't keep track of what was going on. The droning perhaps helped with the nap. Home, then worked some more. Cut my hair. Don't know if it's annoying enough to pay for it all the time. Started watching preview of Planet Earth 2, but it was too low-res and would rather watch it in 4K later. Sleepy now, but want to do something free before I have to sleep. Looking forward to the gym tomorrow.
