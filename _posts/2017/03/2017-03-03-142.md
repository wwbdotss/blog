Farty. From what? Taco filling things at work all-hands meeting?

Allergies are killing me. Not the worst yet even.

Great Friday again, in that I did whatever I wanted. Didn't come home for dinner. Walked way out of the way after work, early too, eating random Trader Joe's snacks. Mango spears and bacon jerky. Starbucks first, didn't eat dinner because I didn't feel like it oh yes. Ben Brown videos. Reddit. Bitcoin. All the vices. Saturday will be like that too. It's all to serve Friday, of course. Friday wouldn't be as great; I have to know I could relax the day after as well. King of Thai. Fish cakes were good this time. Duck noodle soup. It was way too salty. King of Thai isn't really that great, not at all, but I'm too used to it and it's easy and closes late and close and Asian. Sleep now.
