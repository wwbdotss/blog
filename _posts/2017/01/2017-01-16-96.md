I sold the shares. Feels good. I'm participating in life instead of standing on the sidelines. YOLO all the way. If I can get myself doing stuff using this way of thinking, I'm all for it. I invite recklessness. More please.

There is little in this scenario that would make me regret my decision. I'm never going to sell unless it reaches a million. In other words, I'm never selling lol. Like the months-old lottery ticket, the potential and fantasy is the major pleasure here.
