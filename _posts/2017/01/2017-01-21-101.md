I need the full audio protection today. I hate listening to grandma talking to herself. I hate living at home. I hate everything. I fantasized about what I would put on my suicide note.

"This is why I killed myself.

I hate having to live at home. I hate how I had to give up my apartment, which I treasured because it was the culmination of everything I worked for and it represented freedom and control. I will never get over it. I have no freedom or control over my life now. I live tangentially. I hate how I have to deal with cancer and watch it kill my mom slowly. I can't take it anymore. I hate how I've given up on everything because I can't feel better about those two things. I can't do anything about the cancer. I can't do anything about moving out.

I am not sorry."

I hate how suicide notes all say they're sorry. That's bullshit.
