Today was a super normal day. More normal than usual. Everything was average. The only thing that stood out was me stressing the hell out at work waiting around for internal approval. I would not want to do that if they doubled what they're paying me. OK well maybe.

Sleep is sloppy. I've been lying awake for noticeably longer than before. This is the onset of insomnia. I don't know what to do about it. Passing out exhausted is an option.

Don't know at all what to do with my writing. I want to go back to my long book but what did I feel in the car with the Chris Fox interview on that got me so motivated to put that aside and start a more manageable idea? I don't know, it's gone. Might come back. I'm see-sawing. I know what's stalled me. I should have stuck with my original draft and worked harder on the transition. I fucked up my content to make the transitions easier, which is totally backwards. The original scene actually interests me and I looked forward to writing it. Lesson here is to listen more closely to my gut.

Windy slashes of rain fucking sucks. And I like the rain.
