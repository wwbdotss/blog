Watched Survivor all weekend long. I thought I had downloaded all of them, but missed some episodes. Bought more ether. Have to wait until next week for things to clear. Family dinner at awesome clay pot place on Clement. V's "on a break" with her boyfriend, which is in the plus column for me, however remote. I still don't know if I would date her. Sometimes yes and sometimes no. I do like to keep my options open. It was a minus for me that she got a job there. Else it would have been perfect if she moved back here and was also single. But now it's kind of a weird half thing. I could visit her I guess, more easily. Maybe that's where this is pointing. That would be my best play if I were interested in her. Would be nice. I should go.
