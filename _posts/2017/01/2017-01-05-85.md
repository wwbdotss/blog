Today will be a new beginning. In writing at least. I've struggled with this current book for years and I don't like it. I'm going to stop again and write something else. If I stop again again, I'll know it's me and not what I'm working on. Creating something new, what a thrill. I won't use any old ideas I've stockpiled and just make something from nothing. Good.

Went down to Sunnyvale. Learned how nothing's really set. I expected an organized and established process and expected way of running things but there's not really. People were just there. I could have done whatever.

Ate big cup of bean chili at Squat and Gobble, filling, good.

I'm excited to see what happens to a domain I want that's set to expire tomorrow. Would they auto-renew or would I be able to grab it? Going to be fun.

Glad the push ups are compounding. I can do 40 now.

I'm going to close the book file now. Feels good.

Bitcoin is going crazy. I love it. I want to own 100.
