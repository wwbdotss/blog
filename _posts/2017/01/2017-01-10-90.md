Worked half the day at work, spent the rest on Reddit. I'm not compelled.

Hella rained.

I couldn't care much about Obama's farewell speech. What's the point. It won't change anything. Trump's still going to be president.

I'm not getting enough sleep, probably.

I should finish Arcanum Unbounded so I could read all the fan theories.

Haribo Fizzy Cola gummies are the best gummies. Be sure to get the kind with the sour powder coating, not the plain cola ones.

I'm watching way too much Youtube. I bought the Acq Inc special and I haven't watched it because it's so much easier to play a ten-minute video. Same goes for the Survivor season I've been saving for a long break to binge. Didn't happen. Watched Youtube instead. Why doesn't this sort of thing apply to books? Short stories don't sell at all. No one cares about them.
