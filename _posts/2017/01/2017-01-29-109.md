Second day of new year's dinner with mom's youngest brother. Mute. On the ride back, everyone knows what's going on with family news and gossip and relationships than I do. I have no fucking idea who these people are. I should have offered to park the car for dad. I should care more about things. But I don't. So I sat there and ate my shit. I probably have this vacant look in my eyes. I'm not even looking at anything in particular. Just disembodied. My indifference leaves me detached and cold.

Late afternoon early evening Sunday night is the absolute worst time of the week. It doesn't get any worse than this.

Got drawn into reading about fucking Trump's antics. I'm going to stop. I'm going to stop reading about bitcoin too.

I should try out going to the gym for a year and see if there's any difference at the end of it. Take daily pictures. Maybe just weekly.
