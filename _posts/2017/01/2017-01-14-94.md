Can't stop thinking and reading about bitcoin. I've added their value back into my accounting. I'm going to buy some ether too. I'm lumping all this under taxable, and thinking about it this way made it much easier for me to sell my stocks for crypto. Rationalization. I'm excited. Nice round numbers. 100 and 10. Then I'm going to just hold forever apparently. I'm going to sell a bunch of stocks and feel what profit-taking feels like. I want to spend some money. I haven't let myself do that. I will spend when I need to, like random C and E dinners, or trips. I like not having to worry about those too much, but this time, it's going to be a push event. All the force is behind the money, from me, pushing out. No external thing is pulling on me. Amazing. Arbiter of my own destiny! What am I going to spend money on?

I won't spend all on magic internet money. I'm going to withdraw extra to cover taxes. The other part that really sucks will be having a lower tax refund. It's the part that makes me want to wait to see how much I would even get back this year. Property tax is a perpetual, everpresent pain.
