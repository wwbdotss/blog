Don't like Fridays at work. Fuzzy, dim after-work at Japantown again. Wandered. Thought I wanted to walk to Clement again, but drifted to get some frozen yogurt. Way too sweet. I've been eating a lot of sugar lately. I don't know if I have abs or belly fat. Mom's chemo this weekend, so it's lost. What am I going to do tomorrow?
