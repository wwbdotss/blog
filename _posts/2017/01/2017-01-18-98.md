Tired. Should sleep earlier but it's past 11 already.

Rained hard today. Indian buffet for work lunch. Forgot to buy floss. Used the little floss handle things. There's a whole bag of them in the bathroom. Bad flossing experience. Amazon same day delivery of mom's Ensure at like 8 at night. Felt bad for the delivery person hauling the box around in the rain late a night. I didn't have to have it at this time on the same day. But free is free right. What else happened? Coinbase deposited the verification deposits! That was progress and progress feels good. I won't be able to buy all I want for months. This is going to be a super long thing. Narrowed the site. I was supposed to also blog, but don't think that's going to happen. Maxed the width of the site instead! This is fun. Liberating. I don't five a guck!
