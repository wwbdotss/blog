I can't do the minimal exercise. I would know and it won't make me feel anything. At least two reps yo. Aim for three.

I want so many things. I want control over my environment and myself. It would be awesome to build my own house because I could dictate and control every aspect of it. I wouldn't have to settle for whatever's there. I would put it there. Fuck the default. I think I will enjoy Linux.

What games do I play? I'll just need to get Heroes, Pillars of Destiny, and Civ on Linux and there's nothing else I would need.
