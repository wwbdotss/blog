IHOP. Cricket to get V another phone. Slow Cuban restaurant. Out of Vegas at last! Two hour drive. Arizona, just the tip. Utah now. OK Chinese Hunan restaurant. Netflix. Need much sleep.

I felt great when V handed me her fortune to read. "Stop searching for happiness. It's sitting right next to you." Sglee!

Felt awesome hitting the stretch of 15 leaving Vegas. The AUX cable was working and I was listening to all my songs on the car speakers. Bliss. The scenery opening in front of me. I moved through the deep mountain pass and the red cliffsides shifted in parallax as I drove through.

Zion tomorrow? Paddle boarding, must! And selfie in front of the Rocks sign.
