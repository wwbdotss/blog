Travel day. Ruby's Inn is a whole complex, with lots of signs and people and parking spots. The general store has everything. Hot Pockets! I'm glad to be here after hours of driving through stark, sparse country roads where I was the only one there. The emptiness got to me a bit. I got cheap rooms too. I unloaded everything, ate an ice cream cone, and promptly took a nap. My eyes had this band of red across the middle, and I was pretty tired. I drifted. Watched Jurassic Park. It's pretty dated, not really pointing at the special effects, which are cool, but the characters and their interactions, and expectations for the audience, and the defaults underlying the whole thing, which repulsed me. It really is a thriller above all else, the way the action scenes played out. Stupid ending, but whatever. It felt kind of good nevertheless, so I don't know how to explain that.

Didn't do shit, felt great. Don't know about tomorrow.

I do want to stay up and play Heroes though. I will do that and let fall what may.

No, I should really go into the park tomorrow. An unplanned kind of introductory walk around. I should eat a meal, buy some souvenirs, work out at the gym, miscellaney. I don't think I'll wake up too late either. I'll set a reasonable time.
