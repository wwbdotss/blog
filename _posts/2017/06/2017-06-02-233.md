Another aimless Saturday. I time things and make a bid to not have to eat dinner at home, and do it, but it doesn't feel like anything, not worth the effort I put into setting it up. I'm just wandering around here, not taking advantage of my free time. It's just bad on top of bad.

Odesza - Kusanagi (LTR bootleg) on repeat.
