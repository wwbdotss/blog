Last full day at Bryce Canyon. The on-off schedule kind of worked. I had one full day of doing nothing flanked on either side by days where I tried and put in effort. Travel days on either end. It was nicely constructed. I should try to repeat this in other places and see what it's like. It's a nice compact days off.

I drove to the end of the canyon and walked the short bristlecone pine loop. Took some pictures at the lookout. That was it. I went down the rim trail a little it then went back up. It was around 2:30 at that point and I wanted to get to the unwinding part of the day sooner. I'm not too big into hikes, as it turns out. They're ok, but I wouldn't prefer them over, generally.

Trying to close loops. Finished a lot of my food. About to eat ramen! The Marie Calendar country-fried pork with mashed potatoes and apples on the side was really good. Spicy V8 was really good too! Too bad that wasn't very filling. I ate my second peanut butter and jelly sandwich for the calories. I'm cooking ramen in a tuberware bowl in the microwave. That's as rock-bottom cooking as it gets.

For Heroes, I need three heroes. One with Town Portal to guard the home castles. One with offense to conquer enemy towns. And the third, a wanderer with enough defense and magic to not give a fuck and just explore the map.

Tomorrow, I really want to see my 401k transactions in. If not, I'm doing half-year accounting without it, I don't care.
