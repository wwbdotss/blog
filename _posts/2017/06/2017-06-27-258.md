Woke up at 11, not bad. Planned for noon. Bought shuttle pass, then changed my mind because I don't want to be limited by the shuttle's schedule. I also didn't want to go back to the ticket booth and explain that I had changed my mind. Instead, in my weird mind, I preferred to put the onus on the park ranger at the park entrance, with a line of cars behind me. I'm so bad. She just gave me a pass because it was too hard to account for my situation. I wanted to upgrade my $15 no-vehicle pass to the $30 car pass and pay the difference. Go rangers!

Bryce Canyon is kind of boring in that it's one-note. I'm not that interested in hiking the different sections because they will probably all look the same. That's my assumption.

H messaged me and wanted to hang out! I'm so happy that she did that. It makes up for my fallout with V. Switch them out.

I have two full days here, so it's nice to not feel rushed to do anything in partcular. I could try for sunset pictures. I wavered between 1/500 and 1/250 all day long, at f/8. 1/250 might look better. I didn't even want to look through all the pictures I took today because they all kind of look the same.

All Heroes all night.
