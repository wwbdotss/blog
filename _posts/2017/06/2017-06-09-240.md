Well the Warriors lost, so more reason for me not to get so caught up with sports. It's hooking up my feelings to something I can't control.

Work ended up well, the best case scenario, and both my things passed QA. I hate how this miracle had to happen for it to work out. I don't want to put myself in that position again. I need more realistic deadlines. I need to insist on more than one day for QA because it would require perfection to make the deadline. And of course, everyone just takes that as a matter of course and don't recognize how hard and improbable what just happened was.
