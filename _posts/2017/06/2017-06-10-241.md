Felt pretty good today. Nothing bad happened. Things stayed pretty even. Good feeling still lingering after wrapping things up at work on Friday. Offered to help dad more, and talked a bit. Gym and hiking. Blue Danube. Went over to E's place on Friday. Ether's up. Would have been good if Warriors won, but whatever. Watching Survivor. Things are OK. This would be a save point.
