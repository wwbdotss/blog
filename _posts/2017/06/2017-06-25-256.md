Woke up after 12. No heart-pounding anxiety about dealing with another human! Today was the best day I've had in a long time. Since my hotel days in Iceland after C left, in fact! I see the trend. I stayed inside all day long. Ate random food. Masturbated. Played Heroes. Checked ETH prices. I fucking sold and realized profits, holla! Now I really shouldn't check prices. It's fallen a lot and I would only get depressed. Selling some now really makes a difference though. It's real now, even slightly. I didn't watch it go up thousands of percent just to see it fall back down with me not doing anything in between. It's not something that happens every day for fuck's sake.

The mushroom condensed soup was gross.

I don't want to sleep yet. I won't, even if I'm tired. I don't care. I want today to last as long as possible. I'll take the consequences.
