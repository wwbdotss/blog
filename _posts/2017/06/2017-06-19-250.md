Took selfie of Rocks sign. Walmart for slippers and toothpaste. Paddleboarding! I know now I don't like being in the water. There are so many losses of control. If I fall, my glasses are gone. That's probably the thing I worry about most. I need fewer points of failure please. That probably explains most of my water fear. Staying at cabin in the middle of the woods. Quaint. No AC, but it's cool enough here that a ceiling fan suffices. Applebee's is the worst restaurant in the world and I will never go back ever, ever again. Bought two dishes, one to eat there and one to take out for dinner later, out of convenience, and both are bad, especially the salad. They do not know vegetables. The food situation is loose and food security is low. I don't know where my next meal is going to come from. Had on Last of the Mohicans while I tethered and researched Zion. Will be hiking the Narrows tomorrow. It will be done! I've visualized the whole thing. Now to execute. I've latched on.

It's clearer and clearer that I am destined for a loner life of solitude and loneliness. I don't do well around people and I don't want to be around them for long. I don't feel good. I don't know how to fix this and make it better. It will always bother me. Like J said, she had tried for over twenty, thirty years and there's no point anymore. It's self-abuse.
