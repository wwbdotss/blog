Took a lot of sunset pictures but they all turned out really mediocre. The moment itself in person was amazing. What a disconnect.

Oatmeal for breakfast, which felt great and healthy. Reorienting.

Temple Square. Everything was too big. The roads, blocks of the city, the buildings of the Square, all diminish people. The pedestrian flags at the crosswalks were a hoot. City Library was mediocre.

Headache and bad nap drowze during hot drive to the Capitol Reef hotel. The hotel is great. Great view immediately upon arrival. Good steak. Great sunset that I couldn't photograph. I stared at it for a long time.
