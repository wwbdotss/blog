Last day at work before road trip felt weirdly final.

Dinner with dad, good.

Half-way done packing. Flying tomorrow. Nervous things will go wrong, as always. Packing clothes so far feels okay. I'm bringing ten changes of clothes. Laundry in the middle. I'm only going to bring a carry-on and my backpack.
