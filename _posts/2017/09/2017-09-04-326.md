Grandma didn't faint at dim sum so that was good. I was hella tense up until I saw her eating normally then I felt better and relaxed. There is such a difference in subjective experience.

Saw 101 Reykjavick. It was interesting to see how Icelandic people lived before the huge boom in tourism. I recognized a few places from the movie, which was cool. The movie didn't say anything or have anything to offer that I haven't heard or read before unfortunately. Glad I saw it, still.

Making myself work more on the book. I have it more in my mind now. I think I can hold things together close and long enough together to write and knit those scenes together. I have like three outlines what the fuck.

I didn't check crypto yesterday and just peeked now. It's a bloodbath. I'll try to not look until the end of the week this time.
