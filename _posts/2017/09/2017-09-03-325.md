Successfully threw away a bunch of boxes and got into the unpacking. I can throw away more of the stuff I saved in the keep pile, but I'm not drawing hard lines yet. That will come some day. Later.

Eating cereal by night.

Dim sum tomorrow. Grandma is going to faint again. I'm sure of it.

Watched PAX streams all day. Kept up trying to work on book. No writing at this stage. I was staring at the outline and figuring out any easier approaches.

I have to be more readable to engage with people. I've tried so hard to hide myself that people are turned off. I don't share anything; I don't give them enough to work with. I'm just stoic and blank and it's hard to find purchase.

I feel kind of sort of excited about telling the doctor that I need anti-depression medicine. That's going to be novel. I'm going for that new experience. I'm really curious how I'm going to feel on drugs.

Cleaned my glasses today too! I found the tiny eyeglass repair kit screw driver and went to work. Felt great unscrewing the nosepads and cleaning that nasty mold crap from the crevices.

I have to stop touching my nose.

Tomorrow I get to check crypto prices again. I kind of don't want to so soon. It was down the last time I checked. It'll take more than a day to recover, if it did recover today, and another day to go higher. That's my guess. I could space this out by a week. That'll be interesting. Would I though? I want the best chance to see a difference. The risk is boredom.
