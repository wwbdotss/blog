Good going-away happy hour for N. Felt nice and easy when I dunked myself into the social out back.

Watched Kate stream, six wins, awesome.

Tomorrow down south bay with E and eye exam with E. Having to go to the wedding won't ruin that for me. Basically filled out all the forms for city hall next week. Glad V is going with dad. I just need to confirm one form on Monday, and even if I don't get a good answer, I'm going with the form I have.

And then, accounting!
