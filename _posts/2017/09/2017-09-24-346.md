Really annoyed with V for making me go to the wedding.

Good seeing S. Lunch, then walked around Irving. Went up to her apartment. I suck because I lied about where I lived. I don't want to bring up that mom died. I probably won't tell anyone. That's a choice I can make. I don't give a fuck.

The acne medication is working! It makes so much sense in hindsight. Oil + bacteria = acne. I had just been taking care of the oil (and not that well either) and not doing anything about the bacteria. I'm pretty much slathering alcohol on my face twice a day. No breakouts since. Love it.

Make Me Feel Better is really good. Can't stop bobbing.

Gym today. It was pretty mediocre. I had jeans on and having the phone and wired earphones as a hassle mess.

This weekend felt way too fast. Today doesn't feel like a Sunday. I want another day.

Listening to Purple Rain for the first time.
