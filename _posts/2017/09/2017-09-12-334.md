Filed DMV paperwork. Cashed check. Car problem super all done. Feels so good. I'm at baseline contentment.

Canceled Netflix again. I've had my fill of zombies.

What now? Watched more Kate streams. I need to cut back and bring balance to my life. Maybe I can keep up with bitcoin but not check ether prices or visit ethtrader but ethereum is ok? I don't know; I do want to keep tabs on them. Let me do that...

Future: Back to writing. Doctor's appointment Friday. Have to figure out a Gmail bug tomorrow.
