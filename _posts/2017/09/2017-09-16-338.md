Had oatmeal. Felt super tired after because of the vaccine and went back to bed for an hour or so then left the house to get lunch. I wanted to get some Blaze pizza but then couldn't resist the proximity of KFC and Parkside. Got super salty pot pie, read a chapter from the book I reserved, but too bored to keep going. Cancelled the reserve without checking it out. Watched Kate stream, then home for dinner. More Kate stream.

I worked on the book a little. I'm going to keep this up. Daily slice of work on the book. It'll amount to something some day.
