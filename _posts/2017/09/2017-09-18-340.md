Getting one piece of the story into place saved the entire night. It's taking shape and heading towards a reasonable plot.

Proud of a moment at work for finding out an old radar to confirm why we had documented a previous fix. Helping a tiny way.

The Accidental Time Machine has really gone downhill and is pretty disposable now. I don't care about anything that's happening and I can see the author in the story, which is the thing I hate the most. It's contamination. I don't fucking want to see you there! The white male gaze is strong in this one and it's annoying as fuck. Things are just happening too, so the story is not well put together. I just want to skimp and finish it off.
