S asked me to lunch, which I agreed to easily. I'm surprised she still wants to keep in touch.

Watched Kate stream, felt good.

All of the work I'm putting into the story right now is through sorting out the multiple outlines, not sure if I want to keep it that complicated, and thinking through plot questions for logic. Events have to make sense and characters need to have solid motivation. I am sick of random things happening without good reason. It's lazy. I won't let myself do it.
