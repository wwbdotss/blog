Still hella hot.

My best plan to follow ETH is to only check every other day. I've given up any illusions of staying away for longer than that. My rationalization engine kicks into high gear and I convince myself and convince myself. Every other day gives me a nice pat on my own back for resisting then allowing myself to indulge.

I'm catching the worry disease. Everyone is going to die. Fucking sucks.

What's going to happen tomorrow? Nothing.

Went to eat at the one pot place. Bad experience. Strobbing light from the fan. Didn't realize it was closing soon, so felt really rushed. Was super passive with the waitress and just accepted my ill luck.

Itchy as hell. I've opened four of the size windows. I'm going to leave the desk window with the hole in the screen shut from now on. I'm going to try to at least not make it so easy for the bugs.

PAX streams.
