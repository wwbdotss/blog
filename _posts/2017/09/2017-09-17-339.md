Got a book I'm excited to read, The Accidental Time Machine. I like time travel stories because they appeal to my fantasy of having more control over my life than I do.

The baseline continues. Nothing wrong. Things are normal. I wonder how long this will last before another disaster or crappy thing comes along for me to deal with. My standard is really low, and even that is too much to ask for. The universe, just leave me alone.

Watching The Walking Dead, watching Kate stream, and working on straightening out plot lines for the book. Reading something. That's all I'm doing. Slowly cleaning out my room. I successfully donated a bag of clothes I've had since forever. I will unload another load and go through more from the closet. I'll unpack more boxes eventually too.

I watched a Kate stream of Life Is Strange, the prequel, and it was nice, later on. The beginning it was hard to put up with the angsty teenage protagonist. Then the character interactions kicked in and it was pretty great. Plus the reactions from Kate. I can so easily see how people would pay for this virtual one-way companionship. Everybody wants friends.
