Hella hot.

Dinner with E in Chinatown at a restaurant that was unfortunately too touristy and had expensive dishes. I will try for somewhere deeper next time.

Got conference reimbursement check. Felt so great and squared away cashing that in. I'm also grabbing the credit card cash back to really put a dent in this month's expenses. I want another sub-1000 month.

I've successfully avoided checking crypto today. It was so hard. I was tempted all along the way, even now. I might have caught a glimpse of $4900 bitcoin? It's too fast for me. I can only imagine the drop soon. I will try to not peek tomorrow, and stick with writing. The writing is ass right now. Just awful. That's the only way forward though, through the trash fire.
