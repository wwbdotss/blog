I didn't ask the doctor about depression of course. And not about the potential cancerous moles that have been bothering me. I chose the easiest one, my acme. They gave me a tetanus booster and combo vaccine with whooping cough too. I've been feeling crappy since. My left arm hurts and I'm sleepy and lethargic. I like vaccines in general but they are annoying. I don't get flu shots because of the hassle and guarantee of feeling crappy. I might as well be sick. It's certainly not life-threatening sick like from a flu. Annoying as fuck though.

Went to bed at 9 something.
