First aunt sleep talks so that's more wrinkles.

The pleasure I want from crypto now is mystery, and the delicious unpeeling of it in a long period of time. Like a month. A year would be intense. The initial coming back from four months away to 7x was a happiest moment. The constant monitoring since has been nowhere near as effective. It's chasing that first high I guess. I'm tired of disappointment when the price is low and immediate uncertainty and doubt when it's high. No more. Crypto news is meaningless; there is nothing to miss out on. Price is the only thing that matters. I'll keep trying to resist and see how long I last. I'm definitely looking each quarter for the spreadsheet, so that's probably what the schedule and level of contact will optimally be.

K texted and asked to come down to LA to visit. *Gladly*. L is finally coming back from Georgia too. Yes!
