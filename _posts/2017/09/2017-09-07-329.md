Resubscribed to Netflix to watch The Walking Dead. I feel like I failed and fallen into what Netflix wanted. I like the show so far.

Need to call junkyard back and accept their offer. Insurance did nothing. Still fuzzy why I didn't tell dad yet. I think I want to do more of this on my own. But there's really no good reason. I didn't want to have the conversation and tell him I don't know why if they told me they knew the car, a 2014 black Mazda, that they can't find the person. I should have questioned them more before accepting defeat. That's the real reason. It's not a good reason. I wanted to give myself time to call them back for a better explanation. I don't have time though. I want to schedule a pick up by Monday.
