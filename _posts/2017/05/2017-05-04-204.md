Fully fixated on ether and bitcoin. The prices, dang. I can't look away. There is a lot of immediate gratification and positive reinforcement triggering going on here. I won't be sad if they drop a lot. That just means I can get my other half. I would just hate to see prices stagnant and be boring sideways or decline slowly. I will lose interest sooner or later. I'm going to let this run down naturally, this is too much fun and exciting to leave. I want to at least see above 100 for real.

Bought flights for road trip. It's happening.

I'm ignoring C's text that said she's depressed. I don't want to deal with that.
