V back from NY with cronuts.

Mom in pain, but ate.

Asked for a raise! I finally did it. The answer was inconsequential at this point. Well not completely inconsequential of course but the feeling was all with the act of asking, which was huge. I effected change. How much change? Secondary. It was vague, which is not so great, but the mystery means they could give me more money than I expect. Probably not, but the chance is there.

Cracked my screen. I hate dealing and thinking of buying another phone. I'm going to do my best to fix my Nexus 4. I would bond with it more afterward I'm super sure.

Need to sleep. Going to make gym happen tomorrow.
