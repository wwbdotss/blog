Bose headphones came, but the left headphone has no sound? Have to return it, annoyed. Opted to exchange it, and pleased at least they would send another one to me immediately while I pack up and send the bad one back. Didn't notice the noise-cancelling and it was horrible quality, but that's probably the left headphone being dead.

I am looking forward to this coming paycheck, which should have my raise in it. I'm not excited as much by the dollar amount as I am in updating my spreadsheet and calling credit cards to get a higher limit. That would be tidy.

Listening to Say My Name over and over. Heard it on the work radio surprisingly.
