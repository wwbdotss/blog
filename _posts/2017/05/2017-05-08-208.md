In a kind of walking fog. Didn't sleep well last night because of weekend late nights and boba. I keep thinking about crypto. Will I regret cashing out my taxable? No. It has bothered me for a while now. I should just do it. I'll wait one more day. Momentous, maybe.

Eating dinner with C tomorrow and I don't really want to. It's going to be hours of me getting talked at. How can I control and change this. I should not give an inch. That should be the way to do it. Don't let anything slide.

All my habits are going on the wayside. I fucking don't want to do OKCupid. That place is just misery and waste of time. Why am I doing it that way?
