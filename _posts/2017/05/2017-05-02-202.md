Holy shit, ether! I resisted checking the price until today. 7x. I'm still far away from retiring off of it, but this is super happy news. I let myself be happy. I wanted something, I enacted it, and it worked. Feels good to be lucky and on the right side.

Bad day for mom.

Went to the gym at night. It was bad. I don't want to do that. It feels wrong. The vibe is decidedly downward sloping. My body doesn't aspire to strenuous hopeful activity when the day's dead.
