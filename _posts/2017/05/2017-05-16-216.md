Procrastinating on the road trip planning. This will come back to bite me in the ass.

I'm doing more things like I don't give a shit. I left the send off party without going back and saying goodbye because I didn't want to. I just left. The old lady asked me to help carry her crockpot and I did until I arrived at Uniqlo and then I left her. I didn't feel that bad at all. The train station was just a couple blocks away, but I didn't care. I liked my choice. And like the other time, I didn't want to go to dinner with C and so I didn't. Don't give a shit! Feels good. I don't appreciate what I have.

Sleepy from gym. Maybe I can be a 7:30 person.
