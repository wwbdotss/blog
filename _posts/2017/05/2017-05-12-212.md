Replacement Bose came. Loop closed. Great. No, never mind, not closed. I need to return the broken one.

Finally asked for the credit limit increase. Closed that loop too.

Confirmed what my raise was. Partially closed loop. I need to see my paystub on Monday, then the dominos and chain reactions can trigger, and I can sort out my spreadsheets and 401k contribution percentages and make projects and forecasts. Stoked af.

Corn muffins from Hard Knox. That was a win. Easy thing to bring to the potluck tomorrow and both dad and grandma liked it. I'm contributing to this family! Mom was too sick to eat anything. A string of bad days for her. In decline.

Sleep.
