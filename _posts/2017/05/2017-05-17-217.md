Sold lots of stock. I like cash. It's as much as I'm going to keep for the emergency fund though. I finally feel like I don't have too little. I feel better already knowing I have that buffer. A year's worth of mortgage. 6-12 months. That's checked off, done with, I can move on to other steps on the latter. Roth and 401k will both be maxed now too. The rate is good. I want to get rid of that taxable account, someday. It's a petri dish in a way. Vanguard should just be tax-efficient retirement accounts. Diversify. My core retirement accounts are now a lower percentage though; I've raised my cash and crypto by a lot now. I like this set up.
