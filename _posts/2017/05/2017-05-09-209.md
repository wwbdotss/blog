Cancelled on C. Felt SO FUCKING good. I do not want to spend time with her. I feel bad around her and don't have a good time. I feel guilty because she did nothing wrong but I don't want to keep feeling this way. I'm too cowardly to cut it off directly, but I need to figure something out.

Got my raise. Hells yes. I want that nice round number in my paycheck.

Gym tomorrow, sleep.
