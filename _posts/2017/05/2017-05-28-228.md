Lots of dad and grandma yelling. It's one part of a sucky confluence that makes family life so horrible right now.

Ran away to the gym, that helped a little. Started watching the Amazing Race season I've been saving.

I should keep track of my new things. That should help with my sense of progress. Today I tried the boba at the mall on top of the escalators. It was good. The lowest level of sweetness is OK, good tea flavor, boba fine, nice and passable, not offensive, would drink again.
