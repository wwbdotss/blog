Can't stop thinking crypto. I've just been useless this week. Here's the fantasy.

Trump gets re-elected. Recession hits. People flock to coins. I wait until I get my 2.5. I sell, and buy low index. Retirement.

Is that outlandish? Can it come true?

I can hear the caffeine coursing my veins. I shouldn't have done that. Decaf all the way now.
