Didn't go to gym because I lack discpline. Slept more.

Nothing's going on. I literally don't know what to do. Poop I guess.

Going down to Apple is not that big of a deal because I'm just going to be sitting there. The meeting with the junior producer is nothing. The worst part is entering Sunnyvale. That feels like dying. The office park environment triggers so many bad feelings and emotions and memories of interviews and Aplia and cement. It's disgusting. I dread that drive more than the destination. There really isn't anything to be afraid of. But when I think about that off ramp and connector freeway, goddamn that's dismal.

Can't stop looking because BTC is at $1850.
