End of May, what have I done? Crypto.

It replaced writing as my way out. In part, at least. It fulfils the money and independence part that I like about self-publishing. Writing is now more pure. I can approach it with better intentions. It would still feel good to finish my book, but now that good feeling can come all from the creative side, and not any need to prove myself or stick it to the normies. Crypto satisfies that so well. I want to see the faces of all the pharmacists when I oh so casually tell them I paid off my house and don't have to work anymore. What then! That is where my deepest dark satisfaction comes from. It beats most other types of happiness for me lol. Delight.
