One way to make myself stop reading about ether and bitcoins is to read so much that I get bored. Make it too much.

Gym. Felt good, even though it was in the afternoon. I feel like I'm getting enough good feelings out of the membership to justify the cost.

Random Sunday wanderings and uncertainties again. I don't want to do anything now. Not in the mood to proceed or consolidate. I'm going to let myself deflate.

Playing Odesza to cope.
