Finally looked at the route and got a grasp of the road trip. Packing lots in the first week and slowing the pace way down in the second. I think I'll use that for later too.

I might have a cavity or black mark on my tooth that doesn't look like it was there before, I don't remember. Made appointment with dentist. I am super serious when it comes to teeth apparently.

Turns out it's just a stain. Probably blueberry peel.

Dropped V at the airport.

Looking at backpacks. GR1?
