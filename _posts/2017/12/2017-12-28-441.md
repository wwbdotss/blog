Gym today. Chipotle at Lakeshore. Felt good.

Finished long ass Heroes game at last. Cleaned up some files on the desktop. Really couldn't figure out what to do now that my main obession, Kate's stream, is offline today. It's detrimental behavior, I'm sure. Started watching the most recent season of Survivor. It's the same.

I have no idea what I'm going to do tomorrow. I have all my needs met, and now I'm faced with a wind-swept tundra. I don't know what to do with myself. I'm literally just waiting for crypto to make me rich. I'm wasting away like this.

I'm prematurely looking back at the year already. Four things. Mom dying, crypto, New Zealand, and Utah road trip. That was 2017.
