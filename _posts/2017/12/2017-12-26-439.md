Was really old last night. Kept me up until I put on a long sleeve. I was pumped full of adrenaline too from Heroes. Woke up feeling bad, from the lack of sleep but also from oversleeping, heard the noon siren, and sniffling. Went to Stonestown with V to get dinner groceries. Jamba Juice and Boudin. Helped her cook. Tiring. It seems it's hard to mess up baked potatoes in the oven. 400 degrees for an hour, then left in there after turning off the oven to keep warm. V made lamb, mushroom and kale risotto, ginger beer glazed carrots, and salad.

It was really nice that V also thinks I'm living in a cell in my room up here. My current living situation is not a good thing!
