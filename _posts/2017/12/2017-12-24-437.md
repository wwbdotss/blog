Star Wars good. Nice set piece shots.

I hate hearing people noises moving around.

Installed HD mod for Heroes. So great!

Barely worked on outline.

It was yet another lonely Christmas Eve by myself wandering around the city. It wasn't nearly as bad as last year or the year before that. Still pretty bad though. And it's all self-inflicted. I could change everything about it, my world, my life.
