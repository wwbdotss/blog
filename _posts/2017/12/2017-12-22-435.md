Rolling Out for oatmeal, which really isn't that great. It's ok I suppose. I was trying to decide between that and Borderlands Cafe, which I want to go back to to recreate a nice morning from a while ago. That fresh quiet feeling of being in a cafe in the morning is really awesome. I'll just go one of these days during the break.

Took the stupid 28 across the park to Japantown. I'm just going to promise myself that I will avoid it if I can. I should learn to go down to the 29 instead, every time. Got a calendar like I planned. Did it! It's going to be Japanese woodblock prints again, but oh well. They're soothing. I also didn't want the crappy cheap standard sized calendars. I'm all about that long wall hanging now. Can't go back. Ate at a Korean place. It was good. I would definitely rank Korean food over Japanese, if I really had to choose. Korean food is so comforting and substantial and flavorful.

I also got the onigiri from the side super market and not the main one. I like it there.

Spent rest of time at the YQ cafe, sp?. Yuzu tea plz. I watched streams.

Then I came home and watched more streams. My excuse is still holding up. I'm figuring out my book, defining things I need defined, outlining. I still haven't written, so if I actually get that done, my push for guiltless stream watching would solidify and I might just do this forever. I still feel hella inadequate because everyone's getting married and having kids. That won't go away.
