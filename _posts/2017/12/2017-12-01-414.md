Flew. Watched the Big Sick, which was good. Didn't like flight this time. Hated it in the beginning. Old lady asked me to save her space in line so she could buy some food. The line moved before she got back and I felt bad for not doing something to help her. What could I do? Doesn't matter, still felt bad. It of course got weird because I saw her at seating area of the gate waiting for boarding. I avoided eye contact. It was the worst thing and the kind of social anxiety turned reality I dwell on. Got on the plane and the girl next to me asked if she could switch seats so she could get the aisle because she would need to go to the bathroom. I acquiesced like a spineless loser as always. I hated myself the entire flight. This is BS. I can't just keep letting people walk over me and get things from me. So I was in the worst seating arrangement stuck in the middle so that, and those two mental hangups from before made the long flight, which was so pleasant on the way there that I was looking forward to it, turned out just crappy.
