Last day of work of the year. Had pho with E at the place in Chinatown where mom took me for pho for the very first time.

Vigil for Ed Lee in the park above the parking lot. It just happened to start coincidentally when we met for dinner.

Tomorrow, Japantown.

I wish I could be good at something.

Crypto crashing. Curious.
