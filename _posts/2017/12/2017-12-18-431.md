There was something to do at work today. It stressed me out disproportionately. It's a super simple thing and maybe because I haven't done much for the better part of a month, I didn't want to fuck it up. I had physical signs of distress, it was so bad.

Dad's back. I can stop worrying about that.

Crypto is stupid right now. I'm very uncomfortable.
