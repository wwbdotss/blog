Getting to know my Watson character better. Working on the book during streams is kind of working. I'm in the file at least, have it open, typing in it. Progress.

Christmas break is essentially here. One more day of work, then Friday off. Then week off. I'm looking forward to a bunch of things. Dinner with E tomorrow. Free day of Friday where I'll make sure to spend in Japantown and get my calendar and onigiri. It's been a while since I've been back there. Then Star Wars on Sunday at Dolby. Oh yes. Then Star Wars again with S on Wednesday. And last, doing December accounting on the last day of 2017. Oh yes. Lots of free time in between to watch Kate stream and work on my book. That's all I want to do now. And watch crypto charts I guess. I'm going to stop trying to discipline myself with regards to that. I'll let my feelings be my guide. If I feel sick of looking, I'll stop. If I'm curious, I'll check.

Best time of the year. I haven't this relaxed and great for a long time. There's still emptiness in my heart, but at least the landscape is clear.
