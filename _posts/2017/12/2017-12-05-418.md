Watched Kate stream a tourney. Hella exciting. It also gave me another wide view of how shitty people react to things and twist and disregard facts and reality. But that came after. During her wins, my heart was pounding. This is hella tense and gripping entertainment. Peak feelings.

That's all I did today. I took off work after lunch to just watch the stream in a cafe. Working from home so to speak. There was nothing at work for me again.

Family is just a source of dread and sorrow and things that go wrong. The good things are supposed to balance the bad out, but I'm too fixated on the bad; it completely overwhelms. I just want the bad feelings to go away and have me actually enjoy being at home and around family members other than V. But I don't, what can you do.
