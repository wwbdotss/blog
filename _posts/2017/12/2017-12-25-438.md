Woke up nice, successfully slept in. Dumplings for lunch with dad, V, grandma, and first aunt. Also nice. Soy milk. Spent all afternoon playing Heroes again. HotA is good. Playing in higher resolution is the best. Hot pot, second aunt and uncle came over. From every angle, it was a nice Christmas family time. Except from my emo angle where I hate everything and don't appreciate anything. I can still keep objective in brief flashes, which is still nice. I can step back and check myself. I'm afraid this might not always be the case and I get in too deep into depression and can't see with any perspective anymore. It's scary to think I'm close enough to that edge to understand how far it can go.

More Heroes!

V will be making dinner tomorrow. Helping her.
