I need a good pen name. A super great last name.

I did the same thing at work today that I have been doing the entire week since I've been back. I sat there on reddit and crypto. It's not great. Tomorrow will be more of the same. I did push my luck and watched Kate stream. She was definitely not as comfortable in someone else's studio.

I don't have to worry about cashing out crypto for a long time. I don't believe such a good thing as me getting millions would also happen fast. That would be doubly good, when the original good thing is good enough. I'm super addicted though. I wish I could just indulge and not pay the consequences. For once, let me just get away with not choosing what I should do. The universe does not have to balance out. No lessons, no moral, no nothing. Just let me have it.
