Saw Star Wars again, with S. It was nice. It was easy acquaintance interactions, which I need more of in general. I probably won't see her again for a year.

Empty schedule ahead. Though no quite. There is still an annoying meal with T, dad's old friend. The meal is not annoying because it's T; it's annoying because I have to deal with it socially. It ruins the blankness of my remaining break. I have to think about it now and it's presence on the horizon messes with my OCD. I need complete freedom to feel free and can't deal with any distractions from that. I need the road ahead to be clear. The rest of my vacation is ruined!

Second cryptosteel came. Feeling so complete!
