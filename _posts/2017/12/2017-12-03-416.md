Woke up at 3:37 p.m. what the fuck. It was the thing I thought I could avoid by staying up all day on Saturday. Meep.

Bought a potato, a yam, juice, a yogurt, and gum. Walking around during twilight is the worst.

I hate how things are breaking around and demand attention.

Ate the potato while watching Kate stream, super good.
