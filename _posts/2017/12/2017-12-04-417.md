A top dread comes out of nowhere like usual. The ambulance that came for grandma that one time sent a bill to the old house and only got to me when second aunt gave us the bundle of mail when she visited yesterday. They want their $3800. What the fuck. So that's at the top of the myriad of shit I suddenly need to deal with around the house. None of this stops.

Went back to work today and did nothing. Also like usual.

I'm not sure what I'm doing with the book. I'm still just doing worldbuilding side busy work, excuses to not actually write. I know I can't just write because that's what got me to this mess in the first place. "Just write" churns out huge piles crap I have to clean up after and are distracting as fuck.
