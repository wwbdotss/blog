Went to a new cafe, the Cafe International. It had a lot of anti-Trump memorabilia and sexual position paintings. They had carrot juice, which is a plus. I should not have gotten the prosciutto sandwich. Knowing that cured meats is bad for me ruins whatever enjoyment I have from the taste. It was hard to chew too. The toasted dutch crunch bread sliced my mouth up in a bunch of places. That and the stringy fat from the pork, and my mouth area didn't feel too great afterward.

Took the 5 to get there, then walked around the middle of the city, took pictures of the Painted Ladies, ate at the cafe, then took the N inbound to get to Van Ness so I could take the L back out. A good, new kind of day with all the novelty.

Watched stream, started another game of Heroes, watched Survivor and skipped around a bunch.

Got caught up with a r/fi thread about people who have 750K already or already retired. It added more perspective to how I'm feeling now. I have no interest in my job and don't want to live for work, worrying about how I act today so I could ensure I could find another job later. I hate that relentless laddering. One false step and it's all the way back down. Fuck that. I don't know how to escape either, other than pure luck, which is what crypto has been to me.
