S texted me about watching Star Wars, which is great.

I have so little going on in my life. I want to max things out, make things happen, get messy. It's work, crypto, home, writing, watching Kate stream, this blog I guess, a little bit of photography in the other blog, reading a little, and that's pretty much everything in my life. I need more people. I need to give a shit, care about more things, and put in effort, and build something. There is so much room to improve my quality and quantity of life.

I'm not dreading anything at the moment, which is awesome. No immediate danger anywhere.

Keep on chipping away at the book I guess.

Chapter 30 of Oathbringer is great. I got into it, and cared, and engaged with the book in the way that made me like reading and books and stories in the first place.
