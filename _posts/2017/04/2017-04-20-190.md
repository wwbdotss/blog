Didn't come home for dinner today. I wanted to relax. I walked the northern scenic hill route after work. I got some fries at a local market and low sweet cucumber soda. I sat outside and just ate and drank. Watched people play with a dog. Great.

West Portal one-two after, Starbucks and Squat and Gobble.

Sent off the amended taxes. Free from that at last. V sent me a YouTube song and I read too much into it, at first anyway.
