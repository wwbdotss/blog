Planning for road trip! Excitment of not knowing how this is going to turn out. It can not happen. It's so easy for plans like this to shatter. Can't count the ways. The sweetness is there though.

12 likes on OKCupid, which are meaningless. I'm not paying $10 a month to find out who swiped and didn't bother to message. No replies. It's a fucking slog.

I read a profile today that drew me right in. The writing is great. It's written casually and you could get sense of the person she's presenting without her pushing it. It's effective. It makes me need to update my profile to see how well I can produce such a work. It's a language exercise.

Gym tomorrow. Good.

I liked how simple the work tasks are today. It was just the barest of days without being empty. It's like a dried straw inside a bright barn.

Lots of random things to do and keep track of.
