I really want to play Heroes, but I know it's a trap and I should write. What should I do? I should set conditions on it.

So sleepy. I could just sleep and not do either.

Got cold brew without really thinking that it'll be iced and cold. I feel so alert and wired from the caffeine.

Downloading buttload of DnD podcasts. Whoo.

Helped out at work, which felt nice. I'm being useful. Or at least not completely useless. Validation++.

I'm just going to sleep. I could wake up early and find a place to write. I don't want to stay at home and do it. I could I guess, and put on rain sounds again.
