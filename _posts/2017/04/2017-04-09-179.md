Drove V to her performance early. Walked Lands End listening to the C Team. That was really great. Cafe to send out the rent increase finally. Checked that fucker off. Played Heroes until it was time to go. Watched Barkely Marathons. Then some chef documentaries. Netflix, I feel the pending time wasted lined up behind me.

Ate 2% Fage with blueberries, could hardly taste the blueberries. I should have just eaten the berries separately, wasted. I'll just put jam in next time. Chunk of Dubliner cheese.
