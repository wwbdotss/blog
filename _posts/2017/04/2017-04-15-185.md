Messily did my amended taxes. I bulldozed through it, I didn't care, I wanted it done. Now it's done. I can feel good. Print, write the check, send it off, don't think about it for another year.

At Richmond library, smelly people.

Tried to get a writing process doc down. That's enough attempts at productivity today. Will play Heroes.
