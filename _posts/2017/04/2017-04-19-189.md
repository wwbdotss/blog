Watched videos of guy getting stung by tarantula hawks and bullet ants. That was intense, esp the wasp. Dang.

Wrote check and everything for amended taxes, sealed envelop. Will finally get them sent out tomorrow and close this long ass loop.

Ate chicken sandwich from Super Duper again. It was alright good. Then had boba from Super Cue. Heh super super. The lychee jelly was too sweet. Next time I'll have no sugar in the tea itself.

G will be free for bouldering this Saturday. Awesome. No C though.

More Heroes!
