V sent me a letter and it's giving me blue balls because something as precious and personal as a letter should be more personal! I want it to be about me! But it's general stuff. Beh. I want closeness.

I'm in a deficit. That's the line I'm going to use when replying to C. I don't know what else to say.

Skipped dinner at home. I didn't even eat much outside. I had three onigiri from the off market. And a regular coffee with sugar. I don't feel like eating at all today. It's going to be so hard gaining weight. I'm naturally at home with small bites and walking and running than strength and weights. Whatever, I'm going to defy. I want muscles.
