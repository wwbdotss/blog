I like the C Team. All the fan art's influencing me.

Tired.

Work was meaningless.

Ate potato chips and watched Penny Arcade play Zelda.

I need to stop touching and picking my nose. Full stop. No matter how itchy or whatever it gets. I think my nose got conditioned and super sensitive to any stimuli and I just have to ignore its signals and retrained the nerves.

What happens tomorrow? More mediocrity. Me going to the gym and trying to figure out another schedule has fucked things up. I haven't written anything. I'm not doing any cumulative things. I'm just super tired when I get back from work and the soul crushing commute. I really depise riding that commuter train, squished with everyone, just having my world narrowed down like that. It was almost more than I could take today.

What has to change? I don't know. I guess I have to just come back home and write, against all compulsion and instinct to not. The gym stays.
