Watched Your Name. It was good and wholesome. Pretty. I like the feeling of escapism and living in another world for a few hours.

Got the gym membership, and worked out for at least two hours. I lose track of time there really easily. It's the best place to hurry time up if I need it. Handy. I still don't know what I'm doing so I'm just flailing around and trying out all the machines and making stuff up. Dabbling, so I doubt I'm getting a very concerted and effective regime. I like the cables and trying to pull using my whole body. I genuinely get exhausted and have to take a breather. That must mean something right.

Ate duck noodle soup at King of Thai. Classic lone time wrap up.

Played hours of Heroes and finally completed the original campaign after all these years. I'm in the gaming groove and I can feel my pleasure sensors glomming on that way.

I will obey them.
