Worst mom day probably, that I'm aware of. Constantly throwing up. Can't keep any food down. She's also constipated. Pain from the tumors in the back and neck. Nausea from the medication or from whatever.

I sat really still, listening to all this, paralyzed, in the darkening room, I didn't even want to move to turn on the lights. I just sat there and listend to my mom suffer while my dad changed out the vomit bags. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't know what I could do. I didn't want to move a muscle, just sat here rigid and frozen. This is what hell is.
