Mom looked OK eating breakfast. She boiled me an egg which I ate. And also purple yams, which are the best. Gym. I could stay at the gym for hours. Came and stayed home because mom was throwing up and I didn't want to leave her alone. Made potstickers for myself. Did household chores. Finally threw out my ripped sheets. Rotated mattress. Watered plant. Threw away empty soylent boxes. Threw away empty oatmeal box. Did laundry. Peeled a pear for mom. Looked up routes for the road trip. Even worked a tiny little bit on the outline. Roses. It's all roses. Then hella Heroes. I won't play any more for a while. I really have to promise myself that. It's getting out of control.
