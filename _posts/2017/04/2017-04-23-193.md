Dinner at claypot place with family was nice. Kind of a recentering and regaining perspective. These outings are going to be rare.

I need rewards for work and work for rewards, or else I couldn't do either. So that's what I'm going to do. I will write, then play Heroes. Playing Heroes without writing and paying my dues sucks. Writing without Heroes or anything after to succumb to sucks too.
