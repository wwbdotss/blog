Bad day for mom. I don't know how to cope.

Outage, left work early, wandered around Stonestown, it was awful. I felt so windblown. It reflected my life so well that it hurt. I ate random stuff that never quite filled me and I still hungered for something. I couldn't concentrate. The sun was too bright and my eyes were unfocused.

Bad day in general.

Also, K group texted and everyone responded right away with plans and offers to meet with him. I'm jealous in a weird way. I know I don't want that. Not really. It's something I could never attain with relationships with people. It would take so much out of me. That's the result of his personality and building of friendships bearing fruit. I could never in a million years pull that off. Or want to? It does always feels nice to be wanted. I don't want to waste any more time thinking about any of that. It's just filed under the rest of the crap from today.

No more Heroes for a while. I finished the campaign and don't want to start on more. Closed loop. I don't know when I would pick it up again. Hopefully not any time soon.
