I've been sleeping late the entire week, past midnight, watching videos of people hanging out with friends, traveling, cooking. I have nothing going on but work.

I texted B a picture of dogs at a groomer. I did it because she sent me some travel deals to Athens, $19 a night. I overthink.

I bought more biltong yesterday. I gave in.
