The best part still is staying up.

Woke up past noon. Work messaged me. Bad.

Went to Metreon for Ad Astra. Got mango green milk tea boba, then popcorn. The movie was mediocre minus. I didn't care about anything in it. Got a too salty salad from the soup company. Home.

I'm pretty irritable at the moment. No real reason. It's just annoying.
