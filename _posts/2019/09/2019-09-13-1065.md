Me and M headed to the office. She talked about a reality show she watched where people meet for the first time at the altar. She had slept some.

I didn't feel as nervous about tonight than last year. I knew there wasn't anything I could do if something seriously went wrong. I had accepted my fate.

It was the same room. We pulled up seats. The other people we were with were more talkative and friendlier with M this year, than last year.

Something did come up. It wasn't our fault. We filed a bug. We stayed there until 8. Everything about it is bullshit. I hate it.

M dropped me off at the hotel. I worked some more, and finally slept at 9 a.m. I dragged myself awake at 11:45 a.m. Check out was 12. The hate was still with me the entire time, undiminished.

I took a lyft to the office, and kept working. What the fuck.

I had a good lunch with B. I talked and felt in control of myself. I was saying things I meant to say. I felt smart and clear. I was me, around her.

I looked forward to the bus ride home to sleep, but I worked. I got home, and kept working. Hate level steady.

I slept at 9 p.m. It was awesome.
