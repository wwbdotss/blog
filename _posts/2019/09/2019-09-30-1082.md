I need to stop thinking I would go anywhere with B just because she gives me attention. That's not even anything. I need to base things off reality and not what I want to see. Keep perspective.

I have no motivation to do anything. I'm dry.

Watched the Chinese National Day military parade on TV over dinner with dad, first aunt, grandma, and V.

I'm trying to be more grateful for what I have, as my anti-depressant. It does help.

I felt a turnaround in the shower just at first. I had an actionable item toward progress. The smallest of steps. I could work on a short story while I watch streams. I had this in place for a while ago but it just slipped into watching streams, and I would feel bad about it. Just this one little change changes everything, and I forgotten or didn't care enough to remember. If I could do that, I could keep it up.

Also, I let myself check crypto, which I will do in a minute. It's the end of the month. I checked a few days before and it was bad, so I have rock bottom expectations now.
