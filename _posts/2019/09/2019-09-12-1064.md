Nonstop working.

I worked from home, then cafe, then home until E picked me up at 5. The ride was good, took an hour and a half. Checked in at hotel next to the 49ers stadium. Ate pho. Pho Queen. It wasn't very good. E dropped me off and went home. I kept working until 9 or something. Tried to sleep. Got up at 11:15, showered, and met M in the lobby.
