Normally day back at T2. I was the only one there. I gave some good rebuttal against a bad request from the client. I knew what I was talking about.

Regular schedule is nice.

Asked for PTO next week, which will also be nice.

Bought Lou's sandwich after I ruined my appetite for dinner by getting cream puffs.
