Keynote day. The day of highest risk. So many things could go wrong, and so many things needed to go right to have the day turn out OK. The day turned out OK. I passed the tests I needed passing, and got it out the door on time. Then it was like a 5 minute breather or whatever and then it was preparing for the next thing for tomorrow. Plus the other project for M on top of that. I also needed to pass QA quickly, and I did with no bugs on the first test. That always feels good. It would have been a long ass night if I didn't pull that miracle. Things worked out.
