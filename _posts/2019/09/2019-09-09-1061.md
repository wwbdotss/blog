Blogging from 1:26 a.m. on Thursday 9/12. The past few days were just a smear of constant stress and tension at work, with bits of relief, followed immediately by more stress and tension. It's still not over yet.

On this day, I think I just worked on B's project while waiting for M's project to go live. I totally don't remember what happened. What did I even do? Blank.
