Woke up at noon. Best sleep I had for weeks. I watched streams and youtube. Went to Stonestown out of lack of anything better to do. I read some Stephen King short stories in the library. One was about a monster car that ate people. The other was about someone who died of a heart attack, then her husband comes into the store, and the point of the story was that he forgot about the dog in the hot car, who died. It was the stupidest story.

Dad took us out for my lunar birthday. First cousin was there which I didn't like. Not enough to hate, but maybe. I just don't him or want to see him or be around him. If I don't see him again, it would not be soon enough. I'm just annoyed that we have to include first aunt's family for everything.

I don't want to do anything for anything for whenever.
