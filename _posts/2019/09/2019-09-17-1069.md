Why am I still working hard? I feel stressed and rushed and that there's no time. I can't effect change or control in my environment. I'm sure I'm forgetting to breathe or blink.

Worked from home, and I really shouldn't have. It's not worth it. Just for lunch, it's better to be at the office.

Tomorrow, I'm going to... I don't know. I don't want to care.
