B asked me to go into a darker room to show me her Alaska pictures. Is that a normal thing to do? I felt kind of weird about it, but whatever. I like the attention. I felt flat-footed with my interactions with her lately though. I sure as hell don't have that bouncy confidence and playfulness from before. Sucks. I feel like I'm reeling. As with a lot of things, I feel like I'm squandering opportunities left and right. What am I doing?

I ate a salad at work so ate some fried chicken afterward. I don't think that's how it's supposed to go. I've been eating so badly. I can't just keep eating at the mall. There really isn't anything there.

I speed-walked home. That felt good.

I feel a lot more energetic after the exercise. That's a good thing.

Now I'm listening to a streamer talk about her depression and getting treatment for it. It's so real.

I discovered Offline TV and watching the hell out of it. It's very attractive to lonely people and people who want to watch friends hang out.
