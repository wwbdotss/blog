Stayed up hella late watching Through the Fire and Flames videos. I do this a lot when I hear a song I like. I just play it nonstop until it's bled out.

No more oatmeal at home. Worked and hated how things aren't as they should be. I hated how I felt time slipping by in the late afternoon. 4pm on a Sunday is the absolute worst time. I needed to get out and walk. There is really nothing to eat at Stonestown; I shouldn't keep going there and settling for the food court food. I need to put in the time and find a salad place.

Picked up V at the airport. Currently riding the relief from completing that task and not getting into a car accident. Every time I get out of a car, I feel this immense gratitude and relief I didn't die.

Tomorrow seems empty and a breather day, but it's going to super suck. It's a trap. It'll turn instantly into a shitshow. It's the setup.
