Didn't leave my room today as intended. It felt pretty good.

I'm starting to get nosebleeds again after like ten years of not. What the fuck. I was legitimately sad and so depressed by this. I can't even have this little piece of progress in my life. Everything has to degrade, and be worse off. Why can't anything get better. Why is everything so hard. I don't know to do about it. I just have to deal with this other thing, to add to the pile of shit around me.

I read more of Fall. It's interesting. I'm curious where it goes.

Today was also the last day of my vacation. It's been nice. I just get glimpses into how much happier I was when I had my apartment. I could only do this as vacations, one or two weeks out of the year. It sucks so bad.

I look forward to sleeping on the train tomorrow.
