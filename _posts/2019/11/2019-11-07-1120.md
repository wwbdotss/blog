Tried yerba mate for the first time. It's sold as a supplement instead of a drink, no nutrition facts. Interesting. It tastes like mild tumeric juice.

Worked from the cafe up the street a bit from the usual spot. I liked being anonymous. So tired of working. Picked up Recursion. The nice mystery I like at the beginning of a book breaks really early unfortunately with exposition.

Booked the hotel for Seattle. I looked exclusively for extended stay style of rooms now for these trips. A kitchen with a fridge and a microwave at a minimum is mandatory. A full fridge with a stove preferred. I need to make oatmeal and ramen and heat up soup. I know exactly what I want to do with my time too. I got exactly what I wanted from Denver that time. That set the course for how I like these hermit trips to be. A taste of my apartment days. On the other hand, I don't want something that looks too much like an apartment either. No Airbnbs. I want it to look and feel like a hotel room. That Homewood Suites by Hilton is the best hotel experience I've had. I want all of them to be at least like that. A real table would be nice; that was the only thing missing from that room. High chairs and tables are not comfortable at all.
