Good day. Woke up on the train, ate breakfast on the train. Watched things go by. The view wasn't as good as the route to Denver. I largely ignored what was going on outside. I got steamed mussels again. Still good. I napped in the top bunk.

The worst part is when I'm approaching the last stop. I hate that feeling of transition.

First steps outside sucked. The city just felt raw. I found a market, an Asian market at that, and walking there at night with my luggage felt sketchy as fuck. I was glad I did though. That market was great. Got kimchi.

The Lyft dropped me off, and the person who would let me in just got there too. It was nice that he was there and I didn't have to do the complicated check-in. I wish I lived in this studio. Condos look better and better.

S texted me. C texted me. B texted me. I love it.

Using an internet connected TV is great. Watching YouTube on a TV is so interesting.

I'm going to find something interesting to walk to tomorrow, and buy groceries on the way back. I love grocery shopping apparently.
