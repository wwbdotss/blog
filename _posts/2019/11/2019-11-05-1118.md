Problems with the email lists forced last minute scrambling. Worked late tonight. I made sure to drink soup with V and family before jumping back to work. I don't know if tomorrow something bad will happen. I never know if an emails will screw up. It's dumb. It might as well be by chance. The process is so full of holes, anything can happen.

I do like how A complimented. Working with her is really great. Too bad that, I bet she'll be the next person to leave. I can totally see it. She can have so many other opportunities elsewhere. Or maybe B will leave. That would suck too. Who else would I be said about if they left... Not many at this point. Most of the people I really liked are gone, the ones who left an impact on me.

Now's the time when I daydream and fantasize about quitting. The seed is there. The possibility is real.
