Today felt good because I got confirmation that the send went through ok and nothing bad happened; I talked to A and B at work; I finished sending out a production test; tomorrow there's nothing immediately pressing and I get to sleep in.

Texted C and E about dinner and it's all set already for next Wednesday.

Working from cafe and random place tomorrow. Not going to T2. That place has turned into something already in the past.
