Today was a bad day because dad asked me if I called the girls he wanted to set me up with. That was it. Seemingly, that small thing just threw me into a bad mood that engulfed the entire day, and colored it, deemed it, "bad." I hate how that happens. It's so fucking stupid.

I did some curls and bench presses. I need heavier weights I think. I don't feel ready though yet, control-wise. I could do more reps maybe to ensure I don't hurt myself.

I then walked to a vegan place on Judah. The chili was good. The juice thing wasn't very. I would go there again.

I discovered I should have bought SF to Seattle tickets instead of from Emeryville. I'm missing the transfer buses that would take me over the bridge. I hate this point of uncertainty and hassle I have to do. I had already filed the Seattle trip as all set. Now I have to go back, and I have invalidated my good feelings before. So now, going forward, it's another example for me to not feel safe when I feel like I've completed something. I will never feel safe ever it seems. So that's another good feeling getting eroded and being taken away from me.

C also just texted and said she doesn't like Blue Danube. I texted her to reach out in a downer moment for me, when I felt lonely and wanted someone to reach back to me. Of course, that's the text and response I get back in return. That's what I get for trying. No positive reinforcements whatsoever. Everything is hard.
