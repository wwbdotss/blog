Day 3 essentially. Woke up late, as expected. Wasn't too bad. 9:30. Got out of bed at 11:30. Oatmeal + bananas, yes please. The only thing I really thought about for today was pho. I went out at around 1:30. I walked to the water on the other side, north east. It was underwhelming. It was enough of a walk though so I felt like I did something. It was the minimal. I looped around to the pho place. It was ok. I got a rice plate to go. It turned out super bland and soggy looking. Couldn't have looked better right out of the kitchen. I thought about going to Whole Foods, but I didn't really need anything. It felt great to get back into my warm room. The weather is actually no joke. I know what they mean now. If I had to deal with this for half the year, I would go crazy. It's just cold enough that when you move, you feel gaps in your clothes, so I walk compactly and restrict my movement to avoid extending anything more than I need to. Then the dry heat when you get indoors. It's going to rain on Sunday, so I'll get to really experience the full impact of the drear.

Good experience. Good to see and feel for myself.

I watched a lot of Slice of Matt, and caught up a little with the backlog. Still wholesome and great.

I started reading Fall in the morning. The book is very nicely put together. It makes reading a nice experience.
