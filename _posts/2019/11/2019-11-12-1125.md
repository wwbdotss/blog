T texted me back. I like distinct experiences like this. I don't know what's going to happen next. Best guess is nothing. I need to ask to meet her face to face. That will be the next distinct experience. So far, she seems fine. Working as an affordable housing advocate is so great and interesting.

Work is stupid. I don't like working with A. A is so much better.
