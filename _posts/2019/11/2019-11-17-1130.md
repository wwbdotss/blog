C complimented me. Said she loved how I try to see the good intentions in people. That part I don't know about, but the fact that she said something like that was all that mattered. I have not been more attracted to her since college when I told her I was falling for her.

K invited me and E to a Niners game, which is cool. He also wants to camp next summer, which is also great. I told him about winter camping, which he wasn't so into.

E wants to have brunch with me and C. It's interesting how much he wants to hang out since we reconnected.

T texted me back, and apologized for taking so long to reply, which wasn't long at all, just a few days. I don't now what to talk to her about. I just want to ask her out to coffee and meet in person. That will be the next thing I do.

Don't want to go to bed.

I think my luck's run out wrt TTs. I can't keep it up.
