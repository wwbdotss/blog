Miraculously, I passed TT. My luck still held. It was the eleventh hour. It was do or die. And I made it out. This shit is going to happen again for the next project I'm so sure. This dodging bullets thing can't keep going on. I'm definitely interested in looking for another job that's less dysfunction-as-the-norm.

Everything after that TT approval felt pretty good. I was on the downhill. I took time packing. I kind of moseyed. I went to the mall to eat. Chicken ramen, scallops appetizier. Then ate some more. Papa Beard cream puff, honey and butter with chocolate filling. Then I got some juice and a shot. Then got a rice combo plate of steamed kale and eggplant for that fiber.

Got on the bus at the new Salesforce transit center, which was a super downgrade because now Amtrak leaves curbside at the corner.

Got on the train, and it was all so good. I went to bed immediately. It was 10 p.m. It was that kind of sleep where I didn't feel obligated to sleep. I just drifted and whatever happened, happened. I had all the time in the world, and nothing can hurt me. I had nowhere to go and nowhere to be. That feeling right there was what I craved. And got. Bliss.

I dreamt about G for some reason. He was live streaming.

Also, T asked to meet in person. I was too late and too slow to ask her out. Woop woop.
