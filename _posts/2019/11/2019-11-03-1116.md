Throat hurts. Gargled with salt. Let's see if that works.

I got 32 LP in Plat 4, thought, hmm, I couldn't lose all 32 of that in one game right? Playing Normal feels so pointless, I can only play Ranked. It's pointless in its own way, of course. I came in 8th, lost all those points and was at 0. I'm still in Plat, but fuck. Cowering back in Normal was not an option. It was a decision. I queued up. Came in 8th again. Demoted. Fuccccccckkk. Well, the worst is over. Not much to lose now. I felt a bit more relieved. I played again, came up with the stupidest comp with Blitz 3. Finished 2nd. Promoted back to Plat 4. Oh this game. I'm just going to let that be. No more tempting fate. I'm good with ending the season now.
