It's cold. I'm wearing a puffy jacket inside.

I got so interested in streamer drama. It's crazy how it hooked me.

I finished Recursion last night at 2 a.m. It's a nice book to skim. Characters and descriptions were irrelevant. I zeroed in on the dialogue and exposition and sucked out the plot and explanations of what the main ideas were. It's easy to anticipate what to pay attention to.

I'm wasting weekends like no tomorrow.
