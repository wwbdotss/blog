Didn't blog because I was sleepy. I don't remember what I did. This is so bad, because I'm writing this only two days after. I ate at Split, the usual Mandarin salad. I also got a kombucha. My lunch bills cost over $20 now. It's insane. I got some bad tomato soup at Melt. Fries were ok. I turned in my mail-in ballot. I briefly talked to S as I was about to leave work about elections stuff.
