Holy shit, texting a girl is the hardest thing in the world. My impulse right afterward is to fling my phone away. I'm so nervous and queasy, it's weird. I don't know what to do if she replies. I'm so fucking glad I did it.

Today, I wish I talked more with A than with B. I think A is superior to B in so many ways. I do like my banter with B. But it's a non-starter and starting to be kind of taxing. I can't relax completely, in the way that I feel more comfortable with A.
