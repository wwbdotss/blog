Worked until midnight. It was the worst, well maybe one of the worst days at work. I was so stressed. The stupid TT hangs over everything. There are are these bits and pieces all over the place. I just threw up my hands, mentally, and rode with it.

Relationship with A has gotten worse because of this project, I'm sure. Bound to happen. It was previously based on nothing. A foundation of politeness. It's about time it got some rough edges to it.
