Met up with E. It was ok. He talked a lot. During that time, I was kind of bored. We talked about various things. I'm a lousy conversationalist. There were only certain points when I was alert and present enough to actively say something, and not just a nodding response. It was still a worthwhile thing to do, meeting up with E. It was social engagement and I was interacting with people. Much better than my usual Saturday. We went from Velo Rouge, through the park, to Green Apple on 9th. I got the new book from Neal Stephenson, Fall. It will be a nice one to read on the Seattle trip.

I booked the train tickets.

Played more TFT. Got back to Plat 4. I'm going to stop and not risk getting demoted. I'm curious what happens at the end of a season and what the rewards will be. What could they possibly give people that has any meaning to me. I still feel good about it.

I feel slightly sick. Overall, good Saturday.
