Stonestown. TFT.

Got some clothes for V at Uniqlo. It felt pretty good being in the crowd in the mall during this time. Festive. Got pot pie from Boudin's. It was pretty much just a scoop. Didn't eat the bread bowl. Matcha is now an automatic buy whenever I go now. It makes me feel good.

It rained while I walked to there, which was nice.
