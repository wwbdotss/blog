Worked from home. Slept badly because I kept getting out of bed to attend to stupid email schedule. Woke up at 6:45, went back to sleep at 7, got up at 9, went back to bed until 10. So bad. I should just stay up.

Went to the mall and ate. Matcha, chicken and rice, mea sua, like five sips of green smoothie. Couldn't care about work.
