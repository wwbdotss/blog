The trouble is I hate too many things. Reflexively. It makes me not want to have anything to do with it. And I hate abstract, broad things like, especially things I don't have. Like kids, girlfriend, wife, typical high school experience, liberal parents who support my independence, communication with people. I can't even be specific in my hatred. It's tiresome. I can't relate and that makes me not care.

I woke up past noon, which always feels bad. Made matcha from the packet J gave me at work after I briefly mentioned my newfound interest in matcha. He's quitting, so that sucks. I went out and after walking a little downhill out of lack of direction or intention, I walked back to the diner at the corner and got jook and turnip cake and soymilk. The turnip cake wasn't that good, but the jook and soymilk were. I went to the mall next and got matcha, then walked back.

The lesson I keep having to relearn is that interacting with people I care about, and to think about them instead of my stupid internal problems, is what makes me happy. Just at first, after first aunt asked me if I wanted to try her taro cake two times already, I went out to the kitchen and talked to her and tried it and ate it in front of her and told her it was good. That interaction was the highlight of my day, honestly. It was the only thing that meant something.
