Finished work. Went to see V at the dumpling place. It was a bad dinner. I didn't talk much with her at all. I talked to J who sat next to me, but spent most of the dinner just eating, looking around, avoiding eye contact to people across the table from me because I didn't want to make the effort to talk loudly or join in any conversations over there. I wanted it to end. I left after we got out and everyone went to get ice cream. I played TFT instead and filled in my timesheet. Eh.

Another crap filled week at work I'm sure. Lots of rushing and no time to do anything.
