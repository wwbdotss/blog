Waking up early today didn't feel as bad. I only probably slept 3 hours. Work was fine.

I asked A to get coffee in the morning, which was nice. Then I asked B to lunch. Then she said she passed by a Taco Bell, and we walked over. That was the highlight of the day. I had the most human interaction.
