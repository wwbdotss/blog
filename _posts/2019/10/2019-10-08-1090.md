It's so interesting to follow the Hong Kong protests. How will it end? Most likely, it'll fizzle. But what if it doesn't?

Then there's Blizzard banning a player for supporting the protests. The internet outrage feels so good. Nothing is going to come from it, like all internet outrage. But what if something does?

Dinner with C tomorrow. I know for a fact nothing will come from that.

Felt good at work today. Walked around with A and A. Got A grapefruit juice from the boba place across the street. It's always nice being included. I told B that I liked talking with her, that her face is so playful. I just kind of said it. Random. I remember riding the bus home that I felt like I might even go down voluntarily just to be around my coworkers. Corporate HR has succeeded.
