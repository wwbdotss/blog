I ate oatmeal, iced green tea, and a turkey and bacon sandwich at the cafe. They didn't have the portobello sandwich.

It was fucking hot up in that loft. I have nowhere else to go. It was loud as fuck too because of all the fans.

When I really couldn't stand it anymore, I got some boba, then went to the library. I felt self-conscious with my fellow kid outfit of baseball cap, sneakers, and backpack. I never matured.

This is my small moment of respite. I'm going to work all day tomorrow, then go to G and R's house with E for steak. I need to go to the fancy buchershop.

Visiting friends is so good, and it'll be the highlight of the month.
