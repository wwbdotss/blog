Today was a good calm day. I feel pretty good at the moment. A large part of that is because I won a few games of TFT. I'm hella susceptible.

I didn't feel hurried at work. I got through a review. I sent out a test. I trained M. I talked a little with B. Talked with A, always nice to work with her. A talked to me about relationships for some reason. I told her about the time I dated D, and how she was a bartender. That's my favorite dating tidbit to share. Had dinner with V and family. It's always nice to have her home for dinner.

Good day.
