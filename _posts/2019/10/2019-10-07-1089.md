Didn't want to wake up early and ride the bus down so I didn't. I slept in and worked from a cafe. Suck it, work.

Then I went and worked a long time after dinner. Hm.

I'm so sensitive to noise. I left Starbucks because I thought it would be too noisy. I went to another one, smaller, with no one in there, and I also thought it was too noisy. I had bought a drink already, and had to dump it, because I went to another cafe, Cafe Flores, and finally just settled on it because I had five minutes until the meeting. Cafe Flores is nice. Bad soup though. Canned.

I would not want to watch Kate's stream, then even just watching a little bit, I remember why I liked her stream. There is such an intangible quality there, it's crazy. My mind completely flipped. Something is short circuiting. Some people just have utter charisma.
