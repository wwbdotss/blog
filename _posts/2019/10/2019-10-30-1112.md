I don't know what to do. I don't know how to put into action the steps to improve my life. It's work, and family, and my social life. All are not where I wish they would be. I don't want to work. I wish my dad would worry less about me. I wish I spent more time with friends and was a better friend. I want to move out and live on my own again.

These feelings come up because I'm working too much and feeling incompetent and like I'm always behind at work. I don't know how to train people to lighten my load because training them will take even more time I don't have. I don't know how to get help, so I take a lot on myself and it's not helping the situation. I don't see a future for me at my company and things are changing and I don't know if I can find another job. I don't even know what I want to do.

So I'm stuck, in a lot of ways. At home, with my loneliness, at work.

It's weird that sometimes I would just jolts of euphoria out of nowhere, even with all these things in the background. Nothing would have changed except my brain chemistry, I'm sure. I don't know how to get help for that either. I don't like to talk, so skeptical of therapy. And drugs seem excessive. I can't even articulate what my problems are. It's this self-censorship and shutting down avenues of outside help that's the real problem, probably.
