Looking forward to October accounting. Bonus adjustment to make up the difference between gross and net miscalculation. I need a clearer picture of my normal savings rate now.

I need to do a lot of things. I need to plan for the Okinawa trip. Seattle trip via train, if that route is still open with the fire in the north. I can't keep track of everything I'm supposed to do.

Today was a very low effort day at work. I didn't do much. Only one text version bug. I got the short ribs soup again. I think that's enough for now. I've eaten way too much of it.

Addicted to TFT for sure.

Tomorrow I'm not going to go down to Sunnyvale. Fuck that. I'm not going unless I have to. I'll accept the consequences.
