I got super tired after work. It was strong. I'm so tired of work and tired of not doing anything and nothing happening. I didn't get into the office until like 1 p.m. I didn't want to wake up early to get on the bus, so I just sleep in and call in from a coffeeshop, then I'm just alone in the office. It's so bad. It's actually really awful to be alone in there. I would rather take the bus down. Almost? It's actually me choosing between staying up and being alone in the office. Staying up feels so good. I'm just not going into the office tomorrow. There's no good option.
