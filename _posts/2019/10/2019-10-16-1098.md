I have to get up hella early now to get on a stupidly early call. My quality of life has just kept going down. I fell asleep yesterday dead tired with a headache.

This will go on indefinitely apparently. I don't even need to be on that call. It's pointless; everything's automated on my end. I don't have to know how many emails the lists will load. It makes no difference to me!

I blogged, which felt good. I used a picture of S. I don't know if that's something I need to ask her permission first.
