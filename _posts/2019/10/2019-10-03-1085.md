Well. What did I expect. There is no future with B. There was never anything there. I felt awesome yesterday, and felt the worst today. She told me about her date, and it was clear I was never an option. She said she noticed I sometimes had an accent and that really cut deep into the mental image of myself. I really can't escape my circumstances and my insecurities are real. It's my own hangups for sure. She didn't say it out of anything but a passing comment. It's the thing I fixate on, of course. I just felt super shitty on the bus, but by the time I got off the bus and started walking home, with Elbow's Station Approach in my ear, I felt so much better, with as little reason that got me depressed in the first place. Nothing has changed. My head drama plays on.

A got me boba. She's awesome.
