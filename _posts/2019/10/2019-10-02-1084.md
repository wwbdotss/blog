Here's everything happened with B today. I mentally fix my interactions with her in my mind. It's weird.

I was in a booth to eat my lunch away from my desk. I didn't expect her to come by since that booth was out of the way. She sat down and we were talking. Out of the blue, she asked me when my last date was. I lied about it and chose an outing with S as the example. It's so bad and dumb. Then she said she had a date tonight. I felt...I don't know. Of course I didn't want to hear that, but also, why is she telling me this?

She asked how it's like working with A. So she compares herself to A? I teased her a little bit about her typos. I'm amazed I could do something like that and reach that tone to make it work. Is that flirting? No, not really. Not there yet. Or close. But I felt flirtatious.

I asked, out of the blue, how to meet people. She said well I met you.

That was the highlight of my year. Wow.

All of this doesn't add up to shit though. She is still going on a date with someone else and I am still here doing nothing about anything.
