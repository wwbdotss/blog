Seeing E and E was good. Dinner at North Beach Italian restaurant. It was expensive and not good. White wine was nice. Then we walked toward Fisherman's Wharf. Went into the Mechanique arcade, which had the old timey aesthetic I don't like. After that, dessert place. I loved that. It's my kind of bar, without the bar. I felt completely at ease, and the food was good, and it was nice to talk. Got tired and sleepy from all the interaction. Home, bed before midnight.

I told E about people spotting me walking, like R's mom and H, and texting me about it. Did I need a ride? So funny.
