Watched Parasite. It was OK. I liked how I didn't know where it was going, in the beginning, and then didn't know how it was going to end.

Walked to Lowe's with B after lunch and got a succulent. Being with her is nice. But we have few things in common. It's not a lot of talking as much as it's her giggling, and me responding favorably to that. There's not much base.

I still feel much better, more like myself, when I'm around A.
