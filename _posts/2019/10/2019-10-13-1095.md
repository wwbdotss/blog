Dim sum at new place with family. Then I played TFT. I worked out a little on my new bench. Then I also ran a little on the way to the library to pick up Semiosis and return the Golem and the Jinni. Back home, more TFT.

At 9, after losing a lot of games straight, I stopped and took a shower. I feel more recentered. TFT gives me headaches, unlike any other game I've played. It's the timed insistence on attention that gets me. I really need to play it sparingly.

Next week, looking forward to getting my referral bonus and sending half to E.
