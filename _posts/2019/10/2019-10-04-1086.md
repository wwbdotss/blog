Normal lazy day at T2. Felt good. Got Korean soup. Mosied along. Wanted and ate philly cheese steak because of a video I watched last night.

I got into a bout of texting everybody. G for his birthday. Steak time. C to see where she is. Hope to see her for dinner next week. H to see if she will actually do something with me. Nope. E came back on his phone, so that was good to see what he had been doing.

Dentist tomorrow. Then Blue Danube. I'll bring my laptop and write. I'll just read crypto. The last three months of self-imposed blackout from crypto news is not worth missing out on the news. I'll stop again.
