So this was the horrible day. I stayed up until 4 a.m. working. It's bullshit. I didn't even need to. I could have just asked for more time. If I had communicated, I would have been so much better off.

I didn't finish the job. I just gave up and slept for like two horrible hours and woke up feeling so bad, and made up excuses for why I didn't want to get on the stupid bus to go down to Sunnyvale.

I ate tomato ramen and some tasteless spicy tuna rolls at Japantown earlier that evening. I kind of knew I would suffer.
