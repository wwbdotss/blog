Good day because I talked to people. It felt good to talk to B and S and have lunch. We went to Bell Tower. Had carnitas and guiness. Very good. Told them I want to move away from San Francisco, to Seattle, how Canada is so great. B told me that E once wanted to fight someone at a work event because they were making passes at S. She brought up E at a strip club in Texas and I remembered! Barely, but I did remember it. I said it was funny picturing E sitting there analyzing the situation in the middle of a strip club. It was good to share that.

At work, I hardly did much work. I kept talking to B. She is fun to talk with.

I should structure my life to nurture more relationships and interact with people. And if I feel like I want to be alone, I should do that, and then go back to nurturing relationships.

I'm reading parts of my story and I really enjoy them. A's flashback about the cattle farm, for example. I liked it a lot.

Ate a nutella strawberry crepe at Westfield. It was super sugary and I just ate the strawberries and some of the crepe.
