Work was normal, but that only means it's a setup for bad things tomorrow. It's always an ambush, in my mind.

I want to make myself sleep earlier and get up earlier. It would change my life.

I've been playing Teamfight Tactics, very unexpectedly. I like the matching-three part, that if you collect three of a kind, you get a promotion, and if you collect three more of those sets, you get an even better promotion. That is the entire draw of the game for me. That building up aspect. I wish life was like that. That I could work my way up.

I have to go down to Sunnyvale again tomorrow. I despise it.
