Woke up early today because dad had donated his car and needed me to talk to the tow truck.

More time to play TFT in the morning! I also took a break to catch up on Youtube, which felt strangely good.

Kept editing, so it's not all completely bad.

Waking up early definitely is the way to go. It makes the day seem so much longer.

The tow truck was successful, but the dish people didn't come. I got really pissed and took it out unfairly on the customer support person. They responded very gracefully about it.

Bought a new video card and a power supply. The PC has been constantly crashing during TFT and I'm afraid to play ranked now. Lost a rank. I'm so obsessed.

Talked with E about hardware.
