More TFT. It's all I'm thinking about. I'll get it out of my system soon. I think. I stayed up til 3:30 or 4 last night playing. It's bad.

Today, I did get out for a break. I got matcha from the new matcha place. I will need to ask them to hold the sugar next time.

I'm still writing though. Well, editing. Really minorly. I just need to finish going through this draft, which is still very much a continuity draft and not anything in-depth, then I can start writing something else.
