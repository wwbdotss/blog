I like talking to B at work. I feel in control of what I'm saying. I don't think I can ever be friends with her though. She makes me feel inadequate when it comes to being proactive and doing things.

Felt good just finishing something with a tight deadline.

A asked me to sit with her and A in the courtyard. It was nice. Feels so nice being asked to things and to be included.

A is single again. This interests me, if just something to think about.

J messed up. That makes me feel relieved it wasn't me, and this contributed to an better than average day. It's true.

I'm not going to check crypto for a while. Taking a break.
