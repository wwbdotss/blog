Nothing at work. Very normal. If every day was like that, I would be in heaven.

Cleaned out PC, particularly the CPU heatsink. Something is wrong. It's either the power supply or the graphics card. Something is overheating? I don't know, the video signal keeps crashing.

More TFT. I'm sleep deprived, but I'm making up for it by going to work late, which is bad.
