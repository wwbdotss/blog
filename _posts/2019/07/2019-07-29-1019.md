Helped E scoop up poop at work. She said the 311 lady was rude and wouldn't send someone to clean up shit too close to private property.

I asked C, E, and H if saying condolences to someone whose pet died was too much, if that was just reserved for people.

Finished my work. Relaxed a little, but felt super lonely.

Tomorrow will be more of the same.
