Came back, felt bad, didn't want to go to work.

During the night, I felt super bad and despaired. Then I got up and drank some soylent because I was fucking hungry apparently. After that, my mood changed entirely. I was euphoric. I knew during both ends of that spectrum that I would feel different later on, that what I was feeling at that current moment was just for that moment. I've always felt the most euphoric when in bed daydreaming and fantasizing about everything and imagining everything going right. It's almost giddy, and I love life and couldn't wait to get up and act on those things. Of course, of course, that doesn't happen. It's happened a bunch of times already too, but in that moment, I still believed it could be possible.
