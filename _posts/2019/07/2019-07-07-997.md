I resisted my indifference and made it a point to reply to H, actually reply to her instead of a stock thing that has ended a lot of conversations. I'm glad I did because it was an active act. I didn't give in to passivity. The results didn't matter.

I went to Blue Danube. She sent me a picture she took of me when she walked past. It was kind of weird, since she didn't come in. I went out to look for her but she was gone. I didn't know where to go. I didn't want to just leave because I mentioned that I would be there and they were doing something else in the park.

Then she and other people came by later. She was just talking a lot to them and not me, probably just out of momentum or something. I was bored. They left shortly. I went home.

Started to write again. This is the plan. I will finish this draft, I don't care. I won't start another story until I finish this draft.
