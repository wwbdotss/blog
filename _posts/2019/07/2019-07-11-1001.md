I texted C and want to see her. I then thought about how I really feel about her. Do I have feelings for her? I want to ask her out again, the second time, and see if I get rejected again. I think honestly it wouldn't be that bad if I do get rejected. Again. The again part is special. I like building a history with her.

I took three days off work and I don't know what to do with them. I do want to do something outdoors. I don't know.

I feel better right now than yesterday because I finished one thing at work that made me feel competent. It felt good not only to know about something, but to be able to explain it.
