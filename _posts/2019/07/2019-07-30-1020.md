Who did I talk to today? A little bit with S in the work kitchen about his dog that died. Then about the poop me and E cleaned.

Went to Japantown for dinner. Sashimi combo that had bad tuna. I should never get tuna there again.

B is going to be at the SF office tomorrow, so that'll be interesting.

I didn't play TFT today, so that's a plus. Unfortunately, I watched a lot of it on Twitch.
