Watched John Wick 3. It was worse than 2, which was worse than 1. It was still clear-eyed about what kind of movie it was though. It's ok.

I did minimal work and it was great.

Ate bad gumbo at Soup Company; the mango green milk tea boba was good though.

Relaxed. Good outlook on immediate future. Nothing scary.
