Dim sum with dad, grandma, and V at a place next to the airport. Talked about if the protestors in HK affected fourth aunt.

New video card came. I can play Pillars smoothly now. No crashes so far, but I will have to see if it lasts. I'll return the power supply if so. Or maybe just keep it? I don't know.

I spent more money on Twitch again. I regret it immediately. Never again until I'm rich.
