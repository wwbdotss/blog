1000 days!

I'm not going to work any more than I have to. I don't care anymore. No more free overtime. If I don't get paid beyond 40, then I won't work beyond 40. Easy peasey. I'll accept being slow and not working hard.

I'll write more. That is still and has always felt a legitimate and worthwhile pursuit.

Listened to The Message by Ken Liu. I just wanted the mystery. I didn't care about the father daughter relationship. I don't need that shit. I just want the center nugget idea. It's an alien nuclear waste site. There. Did I need all that wrapping around it? Certainly not as much as was presented.
