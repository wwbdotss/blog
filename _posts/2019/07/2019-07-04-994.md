Dim sum at new place for me in Diamond Heights. Not great.

I played Heroes again. Still fun.

Stupid ass work thing to double check an email. Ruined the feel of the day.

Played more Heroes afterward.

I spent some time thinking and writing my short short story about the king and the cupcake. I have the idea, the point, the *thing* of the story. It's the piece I'm missing with the novel. I think about the core of the story and it drives me to write it, to finish it, to reveal it, to sculpt around it so it shines the way I imagine.
