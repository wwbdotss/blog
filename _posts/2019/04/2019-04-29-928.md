Normal day. Good day at work because I didn't have to go down to Sunnyvale. Always a good day when that happens.

S asked me to go to a home decor house tour. Not sure what that is exactly. Chances to take pictures. I'm a full blown activities partner.

I'm at a steady state today. Nothing good nothing bad. I'm perfectly fine with this for the rest of my life.

I'm getting the thrill from not checking crypto or NBA. Things are happening that could hurt me but I'm not paying attention so they can't. Immunity! Love it.

I could talk to C much more easily than S. S is prettier, which is amazing in how much I keep noticing, and how much it keeps mattering. It's like every time I see her in my field of view, the beauty is tangible. I feel it, and there is a physical response. I can't escape this biology. I want to show her more things than I do with C. I know C is not going to be impressed because she's done much more than me. S, I don't know. She's still mysterious.
