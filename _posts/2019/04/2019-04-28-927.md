I couldn't stand being at home today so I just left and wandered around until 9 p.m., when I came back and watched Game of Thrones. It was a disappointing episode for all the build up and hype. A lot of meaningless action. Most of it was, even the important parts had arbitrary resolutions. I didn't realize the TV show didn't value the lore as much as I did until now. The fantasy portion, even with Bran and the Night King, was definitely a secondary consideration. It's too bad. I have to hope for the books to give me what I want.
