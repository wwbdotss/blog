Happy today because I didn't have allergies. Feels great.

I also feel financially happy. I have enough to max 401k and Roth, with enough left over to add to my emergency fund, plus even more if I come in under my budget. It's the nicest I've felt about money.

I've begun the transfer of more money to buy crypto. I want to buy something in the 100s while I can. I want at least 50 in the secondary account to hold for a Tesla. Dreams.
