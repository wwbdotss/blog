I predict the Warriors will not win this year. Trump will get re-elected. Ether will still be under $200 at the end of the year. Bitcoin under $5000. I will be single forever. I can't see myself interacting with someone on a daily basis. Definitely can't see myself with kids. I'll die of exhaustion. Grandma will die before I turn 40. I'll get laid off in two years. I'll be unemployed after that and won't find another job for over a year. I won't buy a Tesla any time this year, or the next. I will never finish writing a novel. I will get diagnosed with a bad disease before I turn 40.

These are actually just my fears. My fears will become true.
