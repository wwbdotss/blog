Watched Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions. I like them, still!

Ate lunch at lowkey sushi place on West Portal. I really like that neighborhood. The tuna nigiri was great. I was surprised by the quality. The tuna was no watery and tasteless like in a lot of sushi places. It might have been because it was at least maguro. The spicy tuna, maki?, roll was really good too. The pieces were wide and had shiso in it, bonus. I also had vegetable soba. I listened to Shardcast while eating. I got super full towards then end. I still got some frozen yogurt. Then, I wandered into the area east of West Portal with the nice houses. I would live there. I didn't know where I wanted to go or do. It was half cloudy, but I hated the times the sun would break out. Bright and uncomfortable. I walked by Safeway and decided to buy food on a whim. The same basics, yogurt, kombucha, no berries though, hummus. I went ahead and bought milk and cereal, and peanut butter and jam, to have some kind of food at home.
