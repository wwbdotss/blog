Felt super ill on the bus again. At least I didn't throw up.

I feel good after I get off work when I'm down in Sunnyvale, I've noticed. It's nice saying goodbye to people and being around everyone. Secret extrovert. Anti-social extrovert.

Watching more Jenna Marbles videos. She's great.

It's late again. I'm so sleep deprived and dehydrated.
