It was nice watching GoT with S. It was different. We had dinner after. I keep saying to myself that this isn't leading to anything. There's nothing there. I won't ever date her. I don't think I can be around her all the time because I have barely anything to talk to her about. Regular raw events and statements of fact don't last long enough. There needs to be commentary and feelings and wordplay and the second level of discourse on top of the objective facts of a conversation. I don't get much of that at all. So I run out of things to say and she talks about her app. I wish I enjoyed her company more. I do, but not on the level that I crave. I'll ask her to go to Legion of Honor next, which would be fun.

I walked home and listened to Jenna and Julien podcast about scary stories. I love these! They were just reading Reddit threads out loud, but still awesome. I want to listen to these Halloween specials all day long. Reminds me the couple of Taverncast episodes.

Have to sleep early today so I don't throw up on the bus tomorrow. Fuck.
