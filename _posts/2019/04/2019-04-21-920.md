With the $20 code I won on stream, I bought some soft spicy beef jerky from that brand that I like a lot on Amazon.

I feel a really nostalgic sense of loss just now for some reason. I look over my list of podcasts, and see some that haven't had anything released for years and I remember them very fondly. But that bleeds over to current podcasts, that I look forward to listening to every week, and I know that some day they will also be grayed out on the bottom of the list. I can't handle that kind of thing very well right now. It's times like these that I really want to feel connected to people and I'm so grateful for being alive and for the relationships I do have.

This week will be hell at work. I'm just going to go with the flow. It's stupid emails anyway.
