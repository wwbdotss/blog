It rained, but it was muggy. I was hot all day. I could have just worn a t-shirt.

I didn't do any work.

I ate hella lot. Sushi at new place, Wayo. Then pastrami sandwich at Sammi's. Lots of chocolate cookies from work that S brought in. Finished my soylent that morning already. Got a cheese, beef, tomato hot pockets thing at the Ferry building. Then got a puzu cream ice cream. And THEN got a genmatcha milk tea with grass jelly. I don't know why I'm eating so much crap. I felt really bad in the morning, and I'm still wondering if that was because of malnutrition. I felt better after I ate.

For some reason I'm feeling good. No hint of nausea or headache; head's clear. I'm not exhausted. My throat isn't scratchy. I'm not faint. This is so great. I haven't felt this good for a long time, certainly the best I've felt all spring.

I'm trying to pinpoint why. The biggest factor is probably the clean air after the rain. No more pollen or whatever crap triggers my allergies. That removes the most immediate problem. I also ate a lot, so no chance it's a hunger thing. I had a good night sleep yesterday, so that other biological requirement's also taken care of.
