Family and work are both bad. I was supposed to take PTO and I cancelled it because I knew I would work and didn't want to waste my PTO. Lots of work and I doubt I can finish.

First cousin rang the doorbell past 1 a.m. and said he was sleeping here because he was scared. He was blaring music from his phone and must have been walking around like that. What the fuck. I am super unsympathetic. I just think how he's burdening dad. Everyone is a burden on dad. Fuck. He ruined my Friday night, just like that.
