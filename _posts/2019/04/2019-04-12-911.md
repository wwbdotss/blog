I tried to walk home from work again. I didn't do it all the way. Walked to Japantown, where I bought lots of random food. Tried the matcha place, hoping that it wouldn't taste like green tea Kit Kat. It did, so didn't enjoy it. I'll try not adding anything to it, and getting it hot. Took the bus to Park Presidio, then walked from there, through the park, and home.

S asked me to watch GoT at her apartment. Why do things have no meaning?!!
