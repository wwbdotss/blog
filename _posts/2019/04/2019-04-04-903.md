It was an ok day at work. So that was good.

I spent all night reading about Maker and CDPs. I was intrigued, then I realized I would never use it. It's just borrowing money. The basic appeal of it is still greed. It allows people to borrow money, cheaper. That is the biggest value proposition, overshadowing the other advertised benefits like decentralized lending and transparency and all that. If it cost more to borrow than other options, people wouldn't use it, regardless of the other soft features. I still like the system though. It demonstrates what's possible with the blockchain, and it felt good to learning about it.

I'm so tempted to buy more crypto. I have disposable money I don't know else to do with. My biggest motivation is knowing that everything is 90% cheaper. I've dealth with that fine. If it drops 99%, will that be much of a difference? So why not.

I remember setting a memory moment, thinking that I could buy at $100, but decided not to. I'll set another one of those now. It's at $150 and I'm wavering.
