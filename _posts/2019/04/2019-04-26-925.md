Super great day. Dad's back. I feel safe and happy. I'm going to see S tomorrow. Warriors won. Didn't have an immediate pressing deadline at work. Got to hang out a little. Had lunch with A and A, and just enjoyed T2. Finally had some space and time for a breath of air. Things worked out. Got panko, then mango milk tea boba, listened to All the Wrong Todays, whose main character is annoying the fuck out of me, walked a lot. I like it.
