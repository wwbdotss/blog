Stayed up past 1 working on list of unique products with incremental quantities problem. I still didn't solve it. Tonight is going to happen.

A gave me kudos at work and it feels surface good. Doesn't mean as much as its fanfare though. We already work together well so it's not entirely objective praise, the kind from cold strangers. Here, she was being nice.

So tired.
