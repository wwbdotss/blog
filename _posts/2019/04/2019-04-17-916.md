Dinner with E at hummus place. It was bad. I don't know what it was. The chicken liver topping, probably. Everything was so thick.

Went to bar for A's going away happy hour. I fucking hate bars and have never had fun, even the times when I actually engaged.

Have to go down to Sunnyvale tomorrow, fuck.
