I can't watch sports. It's not enjoyable. I only like reading about wins afterward when everything's decided. Well, at least I'm getting good at cutting it off immediately, and it doesn't have to bother me if I don't look for it. It can't hurt me if I don't look at it.

I don't want to go to work. Everything I'm doing is pointless at the moment. I haven't had a regular project for months. I cancelled my PTO request because this week is going to be pretty bad and I need to stick around. Nah whatever, I reverted it back. I need to take a break. I feel tired.
