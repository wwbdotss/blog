I spent a few hours at the Blue Danube touching up draft three. I'm almost there. I can put it aside soon and start something else.

Dismal Sunday.

E is going to quit on Tuesday, which is exciting.

Have to go down to Sunnyvale tomorrow, which sucks so much, just because it's there. Not doing my timesheet until I'm on the clock. Have to sleep soon, which is BS.

Played a normal game, got first, a ranked game, got third.
