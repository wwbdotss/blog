Woke up early and packed everything up. Everything was clockwork. Drove through the horrible narrow road again. Got pho in San Jose, then dropped K off at the airport. Dropped E off. Dropped V and E off. Dropped the car off. Relief.

Walked to Stonestown and ate some mea sua and bad sushi. Home, and watched Rachel and Jun Youtube videos. Hated on the fact that I had to go back to work. Was really tired and had a headache and slept early. Slept really well.
