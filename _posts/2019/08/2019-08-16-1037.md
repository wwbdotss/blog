Woke up early enough to pack. Walked to pick up the rental car. Everything went smoothly. Picked up K. Picked up V and E. Picked up E. Off we went!

Got more food and ate pizza at Costco. Then Safeway for more stuff. Everything fit in the car amazingly. Everyone in the back was probably super stuffed though.

Driving up the narrow 236 was pretty bad. The worst? Maybe. It's up there with Tahoe and snow in the dark. Maybe not that bad.

We got eaten by mosquitos. Bit everywhere on my head.

The same progression of tent setup, food, and fire. All good. Settling into my tent to sleep is a rare pleasure.
