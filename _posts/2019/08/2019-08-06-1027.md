Nothing day at work.

E sent me his resignation email. I don't think he sent it.

R asked me where I want to go for my birthday dinner. I don't think G told her that I had invited him to camping five months ago that weekend. I don't know if they are still the jealous type to hold grudges about people not inviting them to things. Maybe.

Visiting mom's grave tomorrow. Taking PTO.
