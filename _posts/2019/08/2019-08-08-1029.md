Today I talked with S about his bike and had a not very good or consequential conversation. I rehashed my old bike commute along the Embarcadero and my bike accident. I felt just weary as I shoveled those tired old words out my mouth.

Winning at TFT makes me feel good. Got two random comments in chat about how interesting and cool my Rengar with GA, Thornmail, and Warmog was. I can't help but feel good about it. Comments from complete strangers, especially gamers in the in-game chat of all places.

Watched wholesome sliceofmatt videos.
