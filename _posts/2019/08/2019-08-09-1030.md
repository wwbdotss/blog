Nothing at work. Walked home. It was the best.

To Nijiya for Pocari Sweat and some shrimp flat crackers, then the tamago sandwich place. It's still not very good. I got the prosciutto one; didn't get the original one again. Should have. Milk tea and pickles too. Then I went via Sutter to Divisadero. Through the panhandle until I exited to Irving. Took it to 28th, and home.

I stopped at the reservoir and sat there to take a break, eating the flat crackers. It was so foggy and quiet. It wasn't cold though; it was kind of warm, for the time of day and fog. Still summer after all I guess.

Then home and streams while TFT. Slept at past 2. Feels bad.
