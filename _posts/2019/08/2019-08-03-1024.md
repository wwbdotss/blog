Stayed home for the TV tech. It took a long time, three hours or so. At the end of the day, there is no difference in our experience. Everything about us watching TV is the same as before. It was a preventative thing to *keep* what we had. I'm out $50 for it, $30 for a new surge protector and $20 tip.

This is exactly the case with my PC upgrade. I updated the video card and the power supply not for any real gain but to keep what I already had. It fucking sucks. I'm fighting against the current merely to maintain what I already have.
