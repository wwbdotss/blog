Felt bad today. Another depression day. I felt bad for no reason. I was irritable and restless and didn't enjoy the time I was in. I looked to the future with trepidation and the usual pessimism that anything is going to change, that I will change anything. I just want nothing on the horizon, so I can do nothing.

Went to the cafe thinking I would do the stream and writing combo, but I didn't feel it. I did write a little, but it didn't feel smooth. I had oatmeal and green tea. I stayed there for a few hours then left to get food. I defaulted to Stonestown. Ate chicken rice. Got boba. Walked home in the muggy warm fog. My backpack weighs a ton. I need to fix that. It doesn't need to be this heavy. I need a smaller bag.

Tomorrow brunch with coworkers.
