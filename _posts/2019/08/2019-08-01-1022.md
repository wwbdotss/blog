Another month is over. Another birthday coming up. Old as fuck.

I asked T where he was going on PTO, and he's going to visit the M falls in Oregon with the bridge across it. I talked to E about the water cooler. B sent over pictures of her dinner at the fancy restaurant. Talked with E about unemployment benefits.

V's stomach hurts and asked for laxatives, which I got from Walgreens on a night run, but the nurse she called said it might not be necessary since she just pooped earlier in the day. She scheduled an appointment tomorrow, which hopefully she won't need to go to.

Back to Gold II in TFT.
