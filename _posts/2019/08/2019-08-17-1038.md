Waking up in my tent is also a rare pleasure.

Breakfast, then E and K went back to sleep.

I stayed up and talked with E and kept the fire going. It was good to talk to someone new, one on one. I always like talking one on one, I think?

Everyone else woke up and it was lunch and time to eat again. Chopped pineapple with E's sword. Then I took a nap. People went hiking. I woke up and then chopped watermelon rinds with the sword. Ate more food.

There was a general store at the camp site, which was great. Had a good walk with E there. Bought ice cream and queso and more chips.

Played cards with E, K, and V. That was really good.

Put all the wood into the fire and stayed up and talked with K. Good conversation.

The only person I didn't really talk to was V, whom I don't think I can ever really talk to.

Slept a lot easier than the first night, but the ground was still hard as hell.
