Lunch with G and R. It was great! R has changed for the better, I can tell the difference in how she handles setbacks. Korean place with a lot of meat. The soup was good. Cheese on meat is not good. Got matcha after that. Waited in line again.

Home. TFT. Waiting to see C after dinner.

Went to the HK place after dinner instead. Mango sago, soy milk, and instant ramen. Walked her home.

It didn't feel good. I had no fun talking to her, except for a few flashes of interesting things about her stay in Mongolia. I was just nodded and trying to look like I was listening. We actually have very little in common. Nothing at all, pretty much. I had a much better time that other time at the noodle place. I wonder what the difference was. This was a reversion to a few years ago.
