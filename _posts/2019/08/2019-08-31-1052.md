My life is leaking away.

I didn't want to go to cousin's birthday dinner and wandered around. I stood outside of West Portal and watched Youtube over the library's wifi for like twenty minutes. I had gotten some boba and it ruined all my appetite, so I just stayed there until I was hungry or thirsty or anything enough to do something. I got hungry enough to get bean chili and soup at Squat and Gobble. Then I went to Starbucks, which didn't feel good. It was drafty and dim and uninviting. I stayed there watching more Youtube, which is my favorite thing to pass the time nowadays. When it was late enough, I left. I saw a poster for a movie called "Where'd you go, Bernadette?" and texted that to B. It turned out it was a fitting question because she's in Alaska now.

When would I go to sleep?
