Super hot. Bad.

Surprise cake at work. I really was surprised. I like B because she's paying me attention, and that's the only basis of my like. I wish I knew how to cultivate relationships. I went through a phase with S and after a while of nothing there, we stopped hanging out. There was nothing there to begin with but I felt like there was, all in the potential, so the loss felt extra meaningless. What do I do with my feelings.

I feel better about the camping trip after reserving the car.
