I weeded my inbox and that makes me feel better. I also closed all the apps, and that also makes me feel better. Minimizing has always had that effect.

I called Enterprise again and actually got an updated receipt about the overcharge. Need to see the credit to finally settle that.

Commuting is still so bad. The two bus rides become these holes of in-and-out consciousness and weird suspension of time and physical freedom. I'm just stuck on a bus for three plus hours a day.

Talking more with B makes me feel good.
