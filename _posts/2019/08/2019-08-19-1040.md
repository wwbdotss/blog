Went to work and didn't want to do anything. I think my relationship with B has peaked already and the first nice buzz is over and is now just business as usual. I mourn my state of affairs.

My time with the company is on the wane, no question.

I need to make a move or I'll die like this.

I feel more motivated to write than any time the past few years. But that's still just motivation. I haven't acted.
