Brunch wasn't the best. I had no connection and just talked to shovel words out in the open. I didn't enjoy it. It was more performative on my part. I was there just to be there, and to know that I went out to brunch with coworkers. No chemistry. It was what it was.

I walked back. Hella hot. Got bad decaf milk tea at Tpumps. I will never get that kind again.

TFT all afternoon. Have to be down in Sunnyvale tomorrow, sucks.
