I did it, I walked home from work. That was pretty good.

Working this weekend. My wrists are tired. I just want next week to be over.

I'm so bored reading about the NBA and crypto. They're both ultimately so meaningless and based on nothing.

I listened to the Tested podcast on the way. The bitcoin segment was so great.
