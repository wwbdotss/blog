I hate meetings so much. When I saw the invite, I instantly knew I would stress out from that moment until the end of the meeting tomorrow. It ruins almost an entire 24 hours.

It's been raining sporadically. Gusty.

V went to her doctor's appointment! Best news.

Enjoying basketball a lot. No stress. Just watching the East.
