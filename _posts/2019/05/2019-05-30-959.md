Got super energized and motivated after work to solve a work problem. I was all set to grab glory and get accolades. Then I deflated. The one piece I needed to make that sharp impression didn't happen. Without it, it's just another mushy potential. Not real.

Warriors lost; I should not have checked the score. Well, I should, because I know not to check the score for the next two games. I'll see what happens after game 4. Thinking they would lose or get swept is more attractive to me than hoping they win. Hope is a setup. Has always been. It's nothing but.

I'm looking forward to seeing my paycheck tomorrow, and for about five minutes, do something accounting. And then that's it. I'm not going to do any work this weekend.

I should see C. Have dinner with her.
