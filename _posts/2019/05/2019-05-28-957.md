I should not have eaten the yogurt and hummus. I felt so bloated.

Nice clean day at work. QA came back with no issues. Effort led to direct results. I still worked two more hours of overtime tonight. I'm running on fumes.

I bought random things to eat at the mall after work. Cheese tarts and a bag of jalapeno chips at Walgreens. The entire food court had lost power or something. It was dark and all the booths were closed.
