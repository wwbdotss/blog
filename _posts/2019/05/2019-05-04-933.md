No more checking NBA for another week.

Wasted and waited all day for the furniture movers. Didn't get to go to the Monet exhibit with V. Stuck at home with the sun out. When they finally came and finished rebuilding the table at 5, I hurried out to get some of the remaining daylight. I walked to Stonestown, got the mee sua and chicken and rice, and a green smoothie, and walked back. That's definitely become my ritual.

In the morning, I actually plotted out a sci-fi story. Very basic story about people from one timeline colonizing another timeline. It came out fast. I liked that feeling a lot, of pure creation.
