I was super happy in the early afternoon. I ate some oatmeal, which wasn't as good for some reason. I watched some streams, and felt good about being part of them, if just for a little  bit. Some part of me will always like streams. Then I walked to the mall and had on a good episode of a podcast, and the weather was nice. It was all great. I ate stuff at the food court, then walked back, and listened to more podcasts.

I then watched Game 6, and started working. The stupid project is pissing me off now. I just start hating on everything that's not going right and should be. Things could be so much easier in so many other easy ways. Whatever. I just have to get on with it.
