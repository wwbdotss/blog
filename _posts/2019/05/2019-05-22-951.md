What if I actually need more than 8 hours of sleep? Maybe 8 hours of pure sleep, but I need to be in bed an hour or two before or after to set up that 8 hours of actual sleep.

So tired from and of work. I didn't want to slot myself into the commute routine in the morning. I lazed out of bed and wandered around between cafes trying to find quiet places to call in for meetings. It was a bad use of time. I went back to the office in the afternoon. Didn't get a good time to have a proper lunch. Got some samosas and pappadum, which were pretty good. Mango lassi. Bad paper straw. I ate out for dinner. I walked to Japantown, an enjoyable walk, and got a "sando" from a new place next to the matcha place at the mall. It was eggy sandwich on thick white cut crustless bread. Expensive for what it was. I won't go back.
