Boss said that he had something very important to talk about in a meeting tomorrow. What could it be? I'm thinking it has something to do with Rover. Or commuting. Or a new project. Probably a new project that will require me to commute. Or I did something and going to get scolded. It can't be a raise, or a promotion, because for both of those meetings before, he didn't say it was very important. There is nothing good that can come from very important.

I don't have NBA or crypto to obsessively follow. I haven't written or thought about writing for months now. I'll get back to it. I always do. It's so distant and implausible I don't consider it real anymore.
