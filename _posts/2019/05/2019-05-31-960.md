There is no end to work. It's especially bad if it's supposed to be the end but there are lingering problems. Everyone's celebrating but it's not true and it's premature. The worst.

It's not worth it.

I'm just not going to care for the weekend. And maybe not for the rest of the month. Or duration of job! Or ever.
