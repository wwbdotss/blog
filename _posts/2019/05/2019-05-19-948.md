Walked to the Richmond cafes and they were all fucking full and crowded, what the fuck. It was raining and Bay to Breakers, so that's why probably. I'm sick of accommodating for people. I hate traffic lights. I hate lines. I hate standing on the bus. I hate reservations. Everything about scarcity.

Watching Raptors and Bucks game. Everyone's so messy and they keep missing.

Waiting until it's darker to watch Game of Thrones. Then it's oblivion and sleep.

I liked the ending.
