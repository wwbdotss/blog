Endgame was great! Fun and satisfying movie.

Crypto is up and fun again. It's been a while since I've seen prices jump every time I refresh.

There will be a confluence of down turns again. Warriors lose. Crypto falls. Random thing at work not working out. Family problems. But it's not now. Now is good.
