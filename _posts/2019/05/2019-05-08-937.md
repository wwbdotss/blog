I feel momentarily steady. Work seems manageable and I can see a future, if just from this brief vantage point, right now. I'm going to get a $14k raise. Delight! Money has an effect on me.

Tomorrow, when I wake up, who knows. I'm going to go back to hating everything. There is only now, though, and I'm feeling good.

I got off the shuttle at Stonestown and got some udon for dinner. I got some jasmine milk tea with grass jelly at the tea place at the top of the escalators. I then worked until my battery got down to 17 percent, and continued over at the library, which thankfully closed at 9 tonight. I cut it pretty close, finishing with 15 minutes to spare. My wrists and hands are not immune to hurting using the trackpad after all, though only after a few hours of the same motions.

Boss gave me a Night King riding Viserion funko pop for my work anniversary. Awesome. And a Hodor door stop.
