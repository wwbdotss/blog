I feel like coasting to the end of the month so I can get my raise and more money and do accounting on it.

Normal day. I finished All Our Wrong Todays on audio a few days ago. The narrator was annoying. I wanted more from the plot. It was ok.

Tomorrow I have to go down to Sunnyvale, just for my work anniversary, which is a burden for me to go to. I'll probably get sick on the bus and puke again. I appreciate K asking me if I wanted to cancel it though. She's considerate.

Just finished a little bit of work, and now just Youtubing into an early sleep.

I have my short punchy action sci-fi story at the back of my mind.
