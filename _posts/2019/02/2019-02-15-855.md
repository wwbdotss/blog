Feeling good because nothing happened, in a good way.?

Didn't eat at home. Got boba from Chinatown, then had a croissant and tea at Starbucks. Still haven't eaten yet. I'll finish the hummus, and microwave some chicken tenders and potato later. Soylent.

I'll finish the sailing videos tonight.

I feel a swelling urge to do something. I don't know what. I feel like I'm wasting an opportunity here. I don't feel this motivation often.
