Watched a lot of a sailing vlog. Love it. It got me to stop feeling restless and detached.

I got so angry at circumstances, especially on Sundays now, when I have to watch grandma. I keep thinking how stuck I am and consistently can't do what I want. It's narrow-minded. I still feel it though.

I also hate tomorrow when I have to train the new hire because there's uncertainty what he's even going to be working on and I have no clarification how I'm supposed to spend the entire day with him. He can't read our documentation because they've all been moved to the account. It's bullshit and I blame my manager, and the whole way we've been doing things lately. I compared it to my time at my other job and things were so much better organized. Whatever. I'm not going to care that much about my job. It's so pointless.
