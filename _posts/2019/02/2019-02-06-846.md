Feeling better today because S texted me to meet up this weekend. It always feels so good! But afterward, I still feel nothing. Nothing has changed. I don't know what to make of it.

Group lunch at work because A and M came up. It was nice. Also got some work done, which helps.

I should try to walk home from work. Taking the subway and being stuck in a crowded place really takes a toll on me. I will experiment.

Watching more sailing videos.

Oh, happy also because Warriors won and I can read all about it.
