Bad day at work. I hate how much I crumble when things don't go well. I am so brittle and fragile. I instantly think about quitting because I can't stand living with failure. It's ridiculous. I just have to suffer and get over it.

It's 1:12 a.m. and I'm most at peace right now.

I just finished Designated Survivor, all the episodes in seasons 1 and 2 on Netflix. I heard that a season 3 will come out this year. I'll keep watching. I showered and brushed my teeth. There is a whole weekend ahead of me. What could be better. I'm trying not to let things get me down. What am I going to do tomorrow? I don't know, don't care. There is only right now, after all.

Guy Judge is still streaming. Great!
