It's sunny and I'm glad. I don't think I actually hate the sun like I used to. I like variety more than either sunny or rainy. Sunshine after a storm is very nice.

Baked potatoes for dad and grandma.

Watching NBA all-stars game.

Nothing's really on deck for work tomorrow so I'm feeling good. No stress Sunday.

K booked camping for summer. Awesome.
