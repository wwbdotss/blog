Didn't want to commute today, was hoping for a crappy rainy day to justify this but it was just cloudy and drizzly, but I still stayed home anyway. There was still work and I didn't enjoy it. Walked to the mall midway because I needed to take advantage of the open freedom. I needed to eat too. Got udon, then green juice.

I exercised a little. Two sets of curls. I had to go down to 30 lbs because I couldn't do 35 lbs anymore without jerking and twisting. Weak. Two sets of push ups, only 15 each. Two sets of sit ups, 20 and 25. I need some pullups, and some running. Three or four times this every week and I win.

I watched the long PAX West 2018 Acq Inc show last night til late. It was good. It was almost as good as old times. They still have to find a good fourth though. I couldn't sleep much at all. It was because of the earl gray boba I had after work. I'm still so susceptible.

Forgot to download Surivor S38E02 early enough tonight to seed.

Warriors lost, sucks, but it's hurting a little less because I compared it to a couple of days ago when they won and I didn't feel that great about it either, knowing that they weren't safe and would lose again some other day.

I think getting anti-depressant medication would be a good thing. I actually consider it something to look forward to in my subconscious mind at first. I get the same little spurt of anticipation.
