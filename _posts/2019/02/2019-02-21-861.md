Felt crappy all day, then ate sushi from the little outpost in the financial district. I immediately felt better. Great, in fact. I put on Hymn to the Immortal Wind and everything was amazing. I was riding the subway high. Dad gave me grandma's rent and I immediately spent $500 on Twitch, which I had been waiting for the check to do so. I'm up now for the year now that all the property tax and rent stuff cancel each other out, leaving me the hell alone to actually reflect my savings. Hells yes.

I also felt good because I spent a lot of time working at home to pretty up a report.

Also, Warriors won.
