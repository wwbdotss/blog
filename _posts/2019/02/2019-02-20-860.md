Met up with C and I actually felt pretty good during and after. Like, I felt how I should feel after having dinner with an old friend. The place was Spice Kitchen, and I love szechuan peppers. 

Work sucks and I hate it. I need so much to happen for me to enjoy work. If nothing happens, I'm fine. If there's the slightest bit of friction, it's the end of the world.
