Watched the Fountain. It was ok. I liked the themes and visuals. I can relate to him. Death sucks and I will not accept it. All throughout I kept thinking about mom's fight. If this is a character flaw meant to be overcome at the end, well, fuck that, I'm not letting go.

Mondays are bad because all the streamers I like take the day off. No podcasts either. Crypto is bad. Warriors did win though, but it was flavorless. I also have to go down to Sunnyvale tomorrow. Today is background bad. Windy rain and gusts. It's bad weather. I left work early because there was no one there other than L, and she left even earlier. I tired out the Thai place where Little Henry's used to be and it wasn't good. The salad thing was totally not worth it. No one was there either when I went in, and it was awkward eating just with the wait staff.

I'm in the post-story mood now, where I have to take a breather and process the movie. I love stories in this way. It really does leave an impact on me enough to be physical.
