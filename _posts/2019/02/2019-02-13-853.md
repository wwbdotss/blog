Didn't want to commute in the rain so worked from home. It's harder for me to care, especially since I have to commute down tomorrow in a bigger storm.

I started organizing my closet and that felt good.

Ate hummus by itself. I kept the jalapenos I didn't finish from the first batch and ate it with the second, which worked out well. Also ate yogurt.

Watched more sailing videos. I'm nearly caught up.
