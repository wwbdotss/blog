Meeting with S was pretty much what I expected. Got exhausted talking about her app. I don't know what I was talking about most of the time. I was saying random stuff just to say stuff.

Went to Berkeley to watch Blackkklansman. It was also what I thought it would be. I wouldn't have watched it.

Went to the first yakitori place, but there was an hour long wait, so we went to a ramen place--which has a similar name and I didn't realize and led us there before the yakitori--which also had a long line, and we ended up at an empty Thai place. Vegetarian curry. It was mediocre.

Lyfted back. I got nauseated from the ride because I was trying hard to keep talking.

Have to wake up early tomorrow because of Sunnyvale. Sucks.
