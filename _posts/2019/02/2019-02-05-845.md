Went down to Sunnyvale, and it turned out, for no reason. I was not required at the meeting at all. I didn't do anything but sit there. The person I would show up for "client facetime" wasn't even there to show my face to. Going down there was only ever fun exactly one time, the first time.

Ate lunch with coworkers at a taco truck. I'm not into food trucks. The tacos were spicy, which was good. I like A and would ask her out if she didn't have a boyfriend.

Watched more sailing vlogs. It's nice to voyeurize other people's lives.

Feeling good about tomorrow because I have no real deadlines and I don't have to commute down south. I really want it to be a nice regular day.

I'm annoyed at Vanguard for not sending me tax forms yet when they had always sent them in January the years before. Lost respect points. Sent them angry letter.
