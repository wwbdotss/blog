I still want to write. There's still desire there. I'm not going to keep talking about it without doing anything. It feels good though.

Went to the Richmond, but Danube was too full and I left. I didn't feel too bad about it. Throughout it all, I kept reminding myself that I'm happy just being out of the house and away from everyone. I'm happiest when I don't have to deal with people I don't want to interact with.

I listened to podcasts while I walked. I didn't want to think about anything, especially not work.

I ate at the Volcano curry place. Still good.

I wanted to read and finish Murakami. I still could. I will!

I want to stop adding to my emergency fund and start just spending. I want to buy shit. I want to tip streamers. Buy crypto.
