Walked the usual route, went to Danube. I wrote in the dot notebook about what I want to write. Then I came home and went through the my history doc for my story. It feels good to try to clear up and define things. It's the thing that I think I really need to do. It's not an optional nice-to-have, I really think. And I really like it, so I'm just going to keep doing that.
