Finished taxes using Free Tax USA. Compared the refund amount with TurboTax and the federal was the same, so that made me feel better. I got more for state for some reason. Not paying $100 for TurboTax was the best part. I don't care enough about taxes to do my best to be accurate. I'm curious about being audited.

Dim sum today. Rain. Sail videos.

Movie and dinner tomorrow with S.
