Good normal day. Wanted to walk home but it got too late and I didn't do it.

Bought junk food. Gummies, I ate a few, felt gross and threw the rest out. Smoked sausages, non-spicy version. I need to stop eating this cured, processed meat product. Ate a burger for lunch. Got onigiri and boba at Japantown. Took the 38 back downtown instead of going outbound, which was definitely the right thing to do. I should never go outbound. Ate lemongrass soup noodle at King of Thai.
