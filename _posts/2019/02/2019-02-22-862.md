Eyes are so itchy. I hate spring. Today was such a 180 from yesterday. For no real reasons either! L is leaving work, so that's bad. I also hate how I feel bad when I keep on comparing myself to others, especially at work. Little emails nagging me drive me crazy. I'm so disappointed that my beef jerky didn't come yet. Just bad.

Maybe I didn't eat enough.
