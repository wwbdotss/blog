As always the thing I dreaded wasn't as bad as I thought. I will never learn.

I did this by avoiding introducing the new person to people I don't know the names of in the other office. Problem solved yet again by running away and avoiding. Again, I learn nothing.

Rain, but bad, sporadic and windy. Not umbrella kind of rain.
