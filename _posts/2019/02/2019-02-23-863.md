Figured out the work problem. Feels good. Rolling Out, got parfait, shepherd's pie, and green tea. I first walked a little loop beforehand. I could not resist walking down that road. It feels so good to do it, every time. After a while, that wears off and I get tired and I can eat and do whatever after that.

Dad's check cleared and I paid the property tax. I just wait now to have everything settled and I can look at what's ahead. I want to buy more crypto. It's been going up. I want to wait until it drops again, then buy enough to double my pocket ETH and reasonablely cash out for the Model 3.

Museum and lunch with S tomorrow. Maybe S's roommate. I have preconceptions of her already and I've only heard two things about her. It's bad.
