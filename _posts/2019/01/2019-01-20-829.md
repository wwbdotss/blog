Watched Designated Survivor all weekend.

Annoyed that I had to go to family dinners with relatives, then I had to remind myself how fortunate I am to have a family, and that my relatives are considerate enough to invite me all the time. It always has to resort to that and I don't let myself be annoyed. I want to though. That line of reasoning doesn't negate how I feel. So I just end up feeling annoyed and guilty at the same time. I'm used to it.

The two dinners so far were first for my cousin, daughter of second aunt, who had a baby and it's a milestone that the baby survived a certain number of days, 100 I think. The second dinner is for the recent immigration of someone's oldest son. All these are noble and wholesome events that I have no reason to dislike.
