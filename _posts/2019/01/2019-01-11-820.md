Writing this on Sunday afterward and trying to remember what happened.

Woke up around noon. Ate some nice porridge first aunt made. Packed. I sort of knew I wouldn't pick up my dry-cleaning. Lyft to airport. Met up with E at the gate. I got some Tuttimelon. Quick hour and a bit flight. Got Habit burger after we landed. Was ok, not great. Waited for K to pick us up. Went to his apartment for a little bit then out. Koreatown is the best. So lively, unlike San Francisco. There's no comparison. It's the first thing I've seen so far that I like about LA. It felt great walking around and seeing people out. I didn't realize how much I like nightlife. Not stupid ass bar and club nightlife but the Asian kind, with food and markets.

We went to a BBQ place with a braised beef specialty. Waited an hour. It was really good. After, got boba. Walked around K's neighborhood and saw the el pastor food truck. Went back. Watched an 80s Hong Kong cop academy movie, which was great.
