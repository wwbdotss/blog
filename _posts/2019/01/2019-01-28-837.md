Spent all day not wanting to go to second aunt's housewarming, thinking how easy it would be to not go, and in the end the relative that was supposed to drive me didn't go because it was too late. It worked out for me but once again I let circumstances dictate my fate.

I bought grandma some take out from a Chinese restaurant and was happy to get her food.
