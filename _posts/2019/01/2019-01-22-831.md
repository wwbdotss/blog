I'm going to play hooky tomorrow. I don't want to go down to Sunnyvale for no good reason. I don't want to go on an offsite with my boss. I'll deal with the consequences if there are any. It would feel pretty good to just not go to work.

Watched more Designated Survivor. The second season is scattered and outlasted its premise. There is no tension left whatsoever. No more conspiracy or villain, just meandering and aimless. I'm still watching because of the characters, which is interesting. I didn't realize I liked them enough to stay.

Watching one more episode...
