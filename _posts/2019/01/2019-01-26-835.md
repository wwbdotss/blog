Watched the new Murder on the Orient Express. I still like the story.

Went to Danube. I tried out some layouts for my planner.

I listened to the new Mono album on the way there.

Picked up shirts from the dry cleaners. It's still not as clean as I would like, and there's also now a gray spot on the collar I need to bleach out.
