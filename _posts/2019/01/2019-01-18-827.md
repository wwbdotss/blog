Team outing was fun. I want to bowl more now. Air hockey was intense. Won shuffleboard. I got a huge headache afterward because I think I bowled too hard and fast. Dinner for cousin's baby. I was super sleepy too on the ride. I feel a lot better now. I'm up at 1:38 a.m. and don't want to sleep. No headache. It's weird how that happens.

Three day weekend.
