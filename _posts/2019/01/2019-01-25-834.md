Dinner with E, which was good. Bun bo hue at Chinatown place overlooking the square.

Glad I passed TT and don't have that hanging over my head. Super annoyed at QA manager calling me out.

Friday nights will always be the best part of the week. Stayed up. Almost 3 in the morning. Watched streams, Youtube, and more Designated Survivor.
