Feeling bad now because of two very specific things at work. I hate how sensitive I am to external stress. I internalize and magnify everything that doesn't go how I would like them to.

One, I didn't speak during a meeting at all. That was bad. And two, I felt like I led my producer down the wrong path based on my assumptions and it made her look bad in front of the client. I perceived that. I have no idea if anyone thinks this. I also didn't thank the client after asking her for confirmation, then thanked someone else later on, putting my lack of thanks in stark contrast. I can't discern reality at this point. My self-doubt is like a mile thick around me.

I'm not going to think for the rest of the night. TGIF.
