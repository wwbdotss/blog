Work was great. Low stress, just doing work. I treasure the SF office. It's going away.

Got a haircut, which helped my mood a lot. I could do things. I got some bun bo hue at the usual place, which also felt great.

Bad things will start tomorrow when I have to get up early, feel anxious about the bus, drowse fitfully, dread walking into the office cell, forced to talk to everyone, not have autonomy about lunch, get stressed in meetings, not have time to do actual work, rush out to catch the bus for the jerking crush commute back to the city afterward. That is so, so bad. I need to push back against it as hard as I could and not have it be taken for granted or gradually shifted over to become expected. It absolutely ruins the day for me. It's very drastic when I lay it out like that. I would absolutely quit over the commute. No way do I will do this every day.
