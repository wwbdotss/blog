Doing terrible at work. Ignoring Nova. Getting lots of bugs back. Not starting on the Rover stuff. I'm just a mess.

Taking today off didn't feel good at all either. I've somehow lost another good feeling I can't feel back. Having a car would help, I think. I feel so trapped. All I do is wander around, and because I'm just walking, I don't even get to wander far. I got oatmeal, then walked to the library for some reason, I think to just go to a different place. I started hating on the library because of the random public people there. I hate the public, it turns out. I got really hungry and left to eat a burrito which I thought would be cheap but it was still over $10 what the fuck. Why can't I buy anything for less than $10 anymore. This is fucking bullshit. I went back to the library and had to stay there until almost 8 to work. I hate everything.

I watched a few more episodes of Designated Survivor. Had to stop because I have to go down to Sunnyvale tomorrow. Fuck the bus. I'm just getting more and more angry the more I'm recounting the day.
