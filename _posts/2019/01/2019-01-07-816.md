Woke up late and didn't want to get stuck in the tunnel with no reception to call into standup, and didn't want to rush, so I went to a cafe at West Portal. It was a nice marblely place. Drank coffee then decided to buy tea because I was there for hours. Did work and leisurely got to work at around noon. Not bad day at work. Felt isolated and lonely and didn't talk to anyone and there were only a few emails. It was dark and cold.

Have to go down south tomorrow for an onscreen. Ugh. It's not going to be anything but its existence on my calendar like any public event involving people, where anything can happen out of whim and whimsy, gives me anxiety.
