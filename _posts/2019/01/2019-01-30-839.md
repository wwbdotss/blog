It's raining so nicely right now. I have the window open a crack to listen.

The year is almost a month old already. There are no brakes. It's been a month of nothing. Nothing happened. I haven't changed. Likely gotten worse. No progress whatsoever. Losing more ground. Still in a hole. I have nothing memorable or noteworthy when I think back. Well, the LA trip to visit Kevin was great. I'm going to find myself in the exact same position next month. Nothing to show for any of it.

What am I going to do tomorrow that would change my mind about myself? I just have to put effort in. That's the only thing I can do I think. It really just comes down to two things. I can not do anything, which is the choice I've made consistently and is the cause of most of my problems, or I can make the effort, to push, to exert, to act, to do something, anything. The choice is basic. At every intersection, I can choose to do something instead of nothing.
