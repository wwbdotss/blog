Feeling restless. I've been looking at crypto again for some sort of calvary to get me excited about the future. Haven't been writing. Putting no effort into anything. I guess these are classic signs of depression. I know what to do and I don't do it. I don't care enough?

Killing Commendatore is diving neck deep into pure weird ass territory now. Things are just happening randomly in a fantasy world beyond a portal. The mundane part that I love about these books is over and I'm just left with this woo woo crap. Meh.

I'm pretty tired too. More depression.
