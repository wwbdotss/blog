Work still sucks because I haven't resolved anything. Everything is still unclosed and floating around. I need closure and resolution.

I stayed up late planning out my planner. I've decided to use boxes to represent an hour of free time I have during the week. Four boxes every weekday and twelve every weekend. I roughly have forty hours per week that I feel I have autonomy over. I don't know why I visually prefer boxes side by side so much over lists or something stacked.

I lied about being sick again today so I didn't have to commute. Fuck that shit. I worked at Stonestown. Ate another not that great salad at Boudin. Chicken and soba? Went into Peet's there for the first time. Got iced green tea. Used the Merced library today. It was nice. Better than at West Portal yesterday.
