Picked up shirts from dry cleaners. They didn't clean what I wanted! Instead of confronting them and getting my money back or asking them to do it again, I went to another dry cleaners. Mee sua is now a destination food. I really like it. The cashier misheard my order and got me oysters when I said I didn't want any, and also mild spicy level when I wanted regular level fried mushroom. I didn't say anything and just ate my oysters and weak ass fried mushroom. I sat there in the food court and listened to the entire podcast about the new hemalurgic table. It was pretty good. I bought another expensive jacket made from cheapass material from Uniqlo and hope that it's the kind of clothes I need. Got green juice from Jamba Juice and sipped it back home.

Going to watch random Netflix and stay up. Or, should, read. Write? Don't think so.
