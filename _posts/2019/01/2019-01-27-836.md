Grandma-sitting again. Grubhub lunch. The dim sum was ok. Liked the seafood tofu soup.

Streams.

Today felt ok just because my mind latches on to me passing QA on Friday and I don't have to deal it on Monday. Closure is such an effective salve.

I really wanted candy after watching the Golf with Friends candy level. I'm very impressionable. So I'm eating chocolate nuggets. It's good.
