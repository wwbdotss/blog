I didn't do anything. Nothing happened.

I've been waking up later and later. I totally miss the train I used to make. I get into the office late now. I have to call in in the middle of Van Ness. I was half an hour late today.

I haven't been doing work either. I've slid so far. I just go online and waste time, then go home.

Tomorrow is the offsite. It'll be ok. Free food is always good. The bowling part is eh. I hope I make it there. I imagine getting mugged or something after I get off the train. I imagine I'll misjudge the time it takes to get there. Coming back will be bad too. I don't want to go to my cousin's baby shower. I really should. Second aunt and uncle were there for us when mom was in the hospital. I'm very ungrateful; I don't know what's wrong with me. This isn't even a favor. Their daughter had a baby and it's just a matter of showing up to a restaurant. It's decided. I'll be there. Fuck my stupid tendencies.

I still fantasize about donating lots of money to streamers. Donating *again*. I will regret it. It still felt awesome at the time, though, so I'm glad that it happened.

I don't want to sleep yet.
