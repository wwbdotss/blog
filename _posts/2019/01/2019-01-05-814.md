Rain! I cleared out some errands. I wedged paper towel wads behind the headboard so I won't feel like I was prying it from the bedframe when I lean back on it right after I wake up. I hate feeling like that so hopefully this will psychologically help. The base moulding also made a weird sticking sound when the headboard was fully pushed up against it, so I added some padding there too. I don't think it's going to work. It's so ghetto. I ideally would put some fuzzy mover dots, but I couldn't find them at Walgreens.

I worked. It felt really good. Hella productive for like two hours.

Then more Worth It. Streams. I could the Bodyguard if I want to sub to Netflix again.
