Woke up early, to my delight. It was only 9 something. I lazed around for another hour and a half. Got dim sum, then more boba. K dropped us off at the airport. They had cancelled the direct flight, so we had to go through Las Vegas. I just wanted to get home. Bought some coconut juice and edamame, didn't want to eat anything. No more junk or meat. Lyft shared home.

Watching stream I've missed. Have to sleep soon.
