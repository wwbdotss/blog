I'm going to build a desk. It feels great, like when I was planning out my shelf. I love this.

I didn't bother trying to make the most of today or cling to what was left of the break. No matter what I did, time was going to fly by and I would feel like I wasted my time. I was right. I stayed in and it felt exactly like the other days when I went out.

I watched Youtube videos of desk builds trying to see how people solve the sagging middle problem. I want that part to feel fucking solid. I hated that feeling that I had to coddle that weak point and make sure I don't push down too hard or lean on it. Fuck that. I want to jump on that spot and not worry about a thing. That has become my only goal now for the project.
