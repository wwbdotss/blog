Don't want to work. It's cold out.

I never leave Squat and Gobble feeling satisfied. I just keep going there cause it's there.

I feel sad that T hasn't replied to my text. So this is what that kind of rejection feels like. Bad.

Haven't written. I wrote--edited--a tiny bit a few days ago.

What do I want?

I want...I don't know. I want to have a good conversation. To do that, I need to provide that good conversation for someone.

E asked me to his Christmas party. I don't want to go.
