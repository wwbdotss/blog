Holiday pot luck at work. I brought the cheese tarts. No one ate them until the end. I gave them all to A. It keeps happening. I should bring easier to eat things that don't look fancy. I'm glad I got to use those as a topic of conversation with A.

I did it to myself again and waited until the last minute to build an email. I still have to pixel perfect it. Have to do that on the bus tomorrow.

I just need to finish it so I can go to Din Tai Fung tomorrow with A and A. That is the more important thing. I want to eat there with her so much. Chances are though, I'm going to have to cancel it. Ideally, postpone it to Friday.
