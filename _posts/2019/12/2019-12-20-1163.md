Woke up late, worked, ate at tepid pho place around West Portal, Starbucks.

Read a Chronicle series of vignettes about homeless people.

Didn't text T.

Watched some Survivor, but the early episodes are always not that interesting.

Read crypto. I want to buy. I keep thinking about it. Will I regret this again? I have extra money that's just sitting there. Savings account not helping by lowering their interest again. I want to spend $ and that's how much I have sitting around. It's so bizarre how I'm looking for these random things to convince me to buy. What can I do with that $ instead of gambling and throwing it away in crypto? Nothing. I don't have anything I want to do with it.
