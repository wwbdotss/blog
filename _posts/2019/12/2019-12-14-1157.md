Christmas dinner at R and G's. It's like I'm watching everyone else's life from the outside in the cold. I'm at a standstill. It's the same feeling every Christmas. It was still good to talk and be there. Brought soju. A gave me two fist bumps when A left me hanging.

I'm tired of crypto Reddit. I'm going to cut it out of my life, like Twitch and TFT. Easy peasy, done. Reddit too, in general. Deleting the app. I did it. I feel really good about that.

I don't know what I want to do, but I can start by getting rid of the things I don't want to do.
