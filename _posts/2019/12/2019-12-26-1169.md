Day 6. Time is hella accelerating now that I'm past the midpoint. I've also done nothing, so that doesn't help with the time perception. Today was very much like my usual weekend where I walk and look at my phone when I get to the cafe or mall. Then I come back. That was it. It's 9:35 p.m. already and today's over. Then it's tomorrow, then Saturday, then Sunday, then it's only three more days after that, and back to work on Thursday. I don't know how to change my perception of time when I need it most. Maybe I do? I need to do more things to stop my brain from blurring everything together in a fast slide show.

I bought the calendar today. And Exhalation. I know for a fact that the stories in there will be good.

Tomorrow, date with T. I feel weird calling them dates because I'm not doing anything date-like with them. I'm not picking her up, and I have no strong attraction toward her. This is perfunctory. I can't summon up the effort for a third time. I need some kind of pull; I can't keep pushing.
