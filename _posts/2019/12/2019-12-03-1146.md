Told C about T. It was nice talking to her about what I'm thinking and all of it. I feel bad for not talking to C for two years.

I still don't know where T lives, so all my logistics might be for nothing. It would be funny-not-funny if she lived in SF or somewhere closer and I arranged to go to Burlingame for no reason.

Felt good talking to A today, and felt great talking to B.

On Thursday, ideally I would work from home, then Lyft over from SF. Easy.
