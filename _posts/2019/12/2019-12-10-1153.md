The best thing happened, T texted me back. She agreed to a second date! I'm all suddenly validated again. It's so funny how that works. So I'm through the second hardest point. A second date I guess could be more important than the first. It's more validating of who you are. It's still superficial in that you only had one night's worth of information about the other person, but it's definitely more than the initial impression of the first sight.

That made my week.

Talking with B still remains the highlight of my day at work.
