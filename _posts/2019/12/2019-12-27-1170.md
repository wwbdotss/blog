T said she just wants to be friends. Fuck. I feel so sorry for myself and let myself feel sorry for myself still. Then she texted me just now about something we talked about, how we are connected and how we got each other's numbers, so I'm like, she's obviously not thinking the same thing I'm thinking. Of course, she's not devastated about being just friends. I want to act like how I feel, and be all upset, but I replied cordially, yeah, I want to hang out even just as friends. Bullshit. Ugh. I can't even express how bad I feel. I do this to myself. My subjective rarely matches up with the objective, and I hide everything and perform. I've only ever felt everything in sync and I'm myself on super rare occasions. With V, E, K at times, and B, quite often actually. OK I guess that's normal. I'm only myself around people I feel close or comfortable around.

The rest of my break is all open at least. Well, dad just mentioned that I have to be at grandma's birthday dinner. Oh well, easy enough. I didn't have to do or say anything last time, so I'll keep doing that.
