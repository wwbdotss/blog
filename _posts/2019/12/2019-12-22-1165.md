Second day. Does counting down the days make it seem to go by faster or slower? So far, it feels about right. It's just been the second day.

Woke at 11 something, got out of bed at noon. It rained all morning. Lunch at home. Noodles. Felt good. Watched Youtube for a while. Reading crypto. Left for the mall around 2. Got matcha latte with half sugar, which was gross. I wanted to try something else on the menu. I'm sticking with just the tea without sugar, for sure. Got buffalo flavored fries. I should also just stick with regular fries. Bought two more flannel shirts, blue and red. They were on sale. The red one is going to be interesting. Back home for winter solstice glutenous rice balls. Cozy and domestic. Watched more Survivor. Will finish tomorrow.

The one thing I actually did today was ask T out for dinner on Friday. It took me hella long writing the text. I had the same spike of nerves right after I sent. I wanted to throw my phone away. She said yes. I just need to follow up with plans.

I have a headache. Sleeping relatively early today, barely past midnight.

Tomorrow, I'm on call for work, which is bullshit. I wanted to watch Knives Out, go to Japantown, buy a calendar, all kinds of stuff. Now, I'll call the mortgage company instead.
