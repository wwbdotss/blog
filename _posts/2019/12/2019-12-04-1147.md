Not going to let work bring me down. I will compartmentalize.

I was trying to think of ways to not get nervous about my date tomorrow, and I envisioned asking B to hang out afterward since I'll be down in Burlingame anyway, and that suddenly vaporized most of my anxiety about the date. The date would give me such a good opportunity to see B more and hang out outside of work. It's so bizarre and interesting how the thought of seeing B is like a sunburst. It's all I think about apparently when I think back on the day and just feel good about the few minutes I talk to B. I didn't have time for lunch and went down to the cafe with her and got some cupcakes. I got her one too. That's all I even really want to remember because the memory makes me feel good. I obviously have a crush on her.

Chances are pretty slim that she'll come out. It'll be late and it's cold out. I can't wait to ask her though. Send that text. I should just call her. It'll be somewhat appropriate. She's definitely not good for me. But I don't care.
