Day 3. Worked. Finalized date plans with T. Finished Survivor.

I planned to go to Japantown today, but had to work. It sucked. I hated everything about it. I didn't care.

It ended around 3 and I stepped out at 4. Walked to the vegan place, but it was closed. I sort of figured. I was hella hungry though. I saw the Indian pizza place next to the 711. It looked so dismal. I had to go underground. There was no on in there. The samosas were great. Mango lassi was ok. The biryani was meh. The samosas and lassi were enough for me, and I took the rice home.

I don't feel that excited about the date with T. I like the concept of the date, but still have no attraction to T. I should have offered to pick her up, but I don't want to drive dad's car. I hate driving his car. The risk is unbearable to me. I would rather pay $100 in Lyft than to drive his car. And apparently, would rather not pick up my date than to drive his car.

Star Wars with E tomorrow, and Japantown. Going to be great.
