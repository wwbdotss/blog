Day 9. Knives Out. It was a good movie, liked it a lot. I sat in the front row because of the last minute ticket. The movie was interesting enough that I kind of forgot I was craning my head up the entire time. Got boba, wanted milk in it, but they just gave me tea.

I was waiting at the bus stop and left, walked to a cafe in West Portal, to take the train later. There was no way I would have taken the bus, then switched to another bus to get to Kabuki in Japantown today in the rain. Would also have had to do that coming back. Good choice I think.
