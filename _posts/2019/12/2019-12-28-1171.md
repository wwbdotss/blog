Day 8. The break might as well be over. Walked to vegan place and got the chili. I'm always kind of uncomfortable eating it, actually, it's pretty spicy. The beet juice wasn't very refreshing either. I'll go again, but try to pay more attention to the menu. Dinner for grandma's birthday on San Bruno. I hated driving dad's car back.

Watched Rounders. It was bad. I don't like movies set in the 90s apparently, especially with Matt Damon.

Try to get up early tomorrow. I can't keep having this overslept headache around me.
