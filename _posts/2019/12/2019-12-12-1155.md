My new t-shirts are coarse. I bought a buttbload of them, so I'm stuck. I could donate them I guess. I'll still need to get back to finding better t-shirts. Hate the effort over something so trivial.

I'm not trying at all at work. I can feel my indifference seeping into everything I say and do.

I'm going to walk away from the holiday party sad as fuck. This sucks.

Looking forward to sleep.

Do I want a light up keyboard? I've kept it off since I got it. Maybe just use it.

I need someone to talk to. I miss C.

I'm going to wake up early and go into the office. I want tranquility. Today was a mess. I hated that feeling at the nearby cafe when it go dark and there was no light up in the loft for some reason, and the food wasn't that great. I felt trapped by work, which wasn't the cafe's fault really. It felt really lonely today too. Hardly anyone was in there. I don't know how it stays in business.

What am I looking forward to? Getting biltong, which still hasn't shipped, the fuck. End of December accounting I guess. It's a weak thing. I don't enjoy counting money as much as I used to. Maybe it's just today. I don't get anything meaningful out of the data. It's nice to know how much I can spend, but I just get weary looking at how far I still have to go before my balance means anything concrete. Decades and decades away.

I guess sleep is in fact the only thing I'm looking forward to right this moment.
