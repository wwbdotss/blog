First day of winter break. Woke up late, around noon. Walked and listened to Shardcast. I felt so good. Got lychee boba at the eggettes place. I was going to stop at the vegan place, but I still had my boba and wanted to keep walking. I walked through the park, considering getting gumbo, but also kept walking. A small Japanese restaurant on the corner caught my eye. It was open, not many people inside, had a nice menu. I liked the whimsy. I went in. Got ramen and gyoza. Too salty, and the gyoza had mayo on it, so not the best. It was nice though. Got to Blue Danube. Chai. Blogged, which felt nice. Lesbian couple next to me kissed a lot, which turned me on. I lingered, got salad to actually have some substantial vegetables. Bused home. Got kombucha for the biltong I'll likely eat. Some Youtube, finished all the biltong. I have 11 days for this break. I laid it out in Wunderlist, and just seeing it that way makes me feel more in control.

Watching Survivor.
