Don't want to go to sleep. Don't want to work. Just want to stay up.

Dim sum lunch with A, A, and R. It's always so nice to be included. Talked a lot about dating. I did feel annoyed that A talked about her crush. It just means I don't have much of a chance with her. Well, I feel that is the case. Also, she's such an instant commodity now that she's single again. People coming out of the woodwork. It's so interesting.

Don't have to wake up early tomorrow. Bliss.
