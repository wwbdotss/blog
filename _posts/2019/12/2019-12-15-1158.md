I hate having dad trying to get me to do things, like buy another house, or set me up with someone. Even if he's doing it for my own good. I hate anyone try to get me to do things. I automatically resist.

E picked me and K up to watch a football game in the new stadium. I will never be a sports fan. Everything about it, the crowds, the national anthem, the military flybys, the brutal game of football itself, the mass spectacle of violence, especially the people around us. Not a fan at all. I didn't care if we won or lost. I couldn't make myself care anymore. It's glaringly meaningless. It used to be very entertaining for me, but it's just dumb to me now. I don't like it.

We went to get bun bo hue after. That was still very good. E then dropped K off at the airport.

I will just zombie walk through the next week and then withdraw for Christmas. It's going to be a chaotic week, guaranteed because everyone is OK with chaos for some reason.

I'm just in a bad mood again. I was in a pretty good one last night when I was thinking about what I will do next with my writing. I still want to, so that's good. I can edit what I have, make another draft, and then just push it out the door. I'll start on the next one after that. Farm boy epic fantasy. I want to evoke comfort.

Helped V fry donut holes.
