Got chili at Judah vegan place. I added the cashew butter and pesto on top this time, and ate it in a bowl for there. It was good. Dropped off the old power supply and video card at Goodwill. Felt clean. Picked up V at the airport after dinner. That was another thing I felt good about checking off.

Watched random videos about China. I'm tired of thinking about the topic. It boils down to how do you change people's minds. Answer is you can't. The end.

I didn't check my work email at all during the weekend. Fuck that shit. I'll face the consequences.
