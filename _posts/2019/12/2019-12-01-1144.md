Don't want to go to work.

Didn't go on Twitch or play TFT today, so I've kept my promise to myself. Feels ok. A lot of thinking what to do with the time. Filled it with Youtube. It's not as bad, but still kind of bad. I need to moderate.

Bought a buttload of random things that have been on my list for years. Socks and handsoap and hand vac and so on. It's necessity buying; I don't want any of it. It does feel good to check things off the list though.
