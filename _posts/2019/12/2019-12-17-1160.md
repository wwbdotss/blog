I feel better about today because I did some work.

The second office is depressing as fuck. E is quitting as well. I casually asked her about her holiday plans, and when we would come back, and she paused and said that she wasn't coming back.

Graffiti on the gate and a For Lease sign over the company logo.

Got cheese tarts for the work potluck. I tried to find an ugly sweater, which I hate the concept of, didn't find it, so fuck it. I'm not going to dress up. Getting the cheese tarts lifted some stress off though. I could easily participate without participating. My food could be a stand-in for me, see, I cared enough, but I could duck out early or come in late and miss most of the milling around with random people. Efficient as fuck. I could see how easily this would work.
