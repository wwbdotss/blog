Not a great meetup with C. Well, sort of? I don't know. Conversation wasn't good. I didn't have anything to talk about. I did buy a membership at the museum, so that's a plus, and I was able to get someone in for free, which feels good. It was nice seeing the Monet paintings again. She wasn't as interested as S. The difference was evident. We left really quickly. It was nice showing C the observation level. The view up there is really nice. It's not too high but not too low, and it gives the city good texture. The elevation makes the hills stand out well. We got pho and I didn't enjoy the meal because I was trying to figure out what to talk about. The weather was bad. Super bright. The allergy medication was sort of working but not completely so I still felt the edges. I had a slight headache from me having to wear a cap, and the sun, and the allergies. I couldn't wait to get inside.

I'm not going to go down to Sunnyvale tomorrow. I don't care.
