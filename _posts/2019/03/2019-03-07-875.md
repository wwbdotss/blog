Better day at work. I had a good time talking and being around my coworkers. No A or J and less interaction with S and more interaction with the people I like, so it was good. Commute was faster too, still not great, but less bad than the initial shock of it.

Watching PUBG squad stream, my favorite.

Ate dinner at Stonestown, with all Taiwanese street food. It's amazing. Mee sua, squid pottage, egg puffs, and boba. Quadfecta.

And the good thing in the immediate future is the relief of not having to go down to Sunnyvale tomorrow and I can sleep in and be in the calm and quiet and woody office. Peace. I probably won't be able to do anything because my VPN still won't work.

I should ask S or C to watch Hamilton with me.
