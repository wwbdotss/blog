I put in the weights on another dumbbell, didn't think of it. Felt the curls much more doing both at the same time like a normal person.

I finally threw away the gross, rusted, shower caddy.

I need to cross tomorrow's river and I'll be good until whatever happens next week.

How I behave depends a lot, a lot, on who I'm with.

I can't wait to find out if the Warriors won. I enjoy this suspense more than watching the game, because this is more final. If they lost, then I can cut away cleanly and think about something else. If they won, they won, and I don't have to temper my glee in case they lose the lead or whatever during the game. I can rejoice or despair with *finality*. The game should be over now...
