Things are like getting worse and worse. All internally. It's all in my head I'm sure.

I couldn't take it and went back to bed at 4 p.m. to sleep the awful Sunday afternoon away. It is so absolutely the worst time of the week. It's fucking tangible.

I don't feel secure in anything. My health, job, family, friends, anything. This hazy allergy thing is multiplying the awfulness by ten. I don't want to fucking get on the bus tomorrow. I hate, and hate, and hate.

I don't know what to do. Cutting things out only goes so far. I'm still not actively doing anything to help my situation.

I'm going to sell the Raven Tower. I don't like it or care about it. It's too much fairy tale and not enough present adventure.

I'm going to sleepwalk through tomorrow, this week. I don't see a river in sight. Perhaps the end of spring. I do want to wrap up Q1 accounting. That'll feel cohesive.
