Roughly brainstormed a short story, and gave up. I need something new and not dwelling on the past stories. I'm cutting off writing on the previous books. I need to start over with the focus on the characters and relationships instead of worldbuilding, which doesn't lead to anything.

Stayed home, except for a little trip to the library to pick up The Andromeda Strain and boba. Aimlessly watched streams.

I'm going to stop saving for the emergency fund temporarily and save up for the down payment on the Tesla. I'm not even sure if I want to finance everything or put down something. Ideally I would pay all in cash from crypto profits, but that's not going to happen before June.
