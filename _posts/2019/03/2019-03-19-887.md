I got sick of streams and after I got tired of youtube too, this wave of frustration about work hit me. The thing I'm working on now is a pile of shit. I don't know what's going on. There is so much resistance to knowledge transfer. I need to do something. You know how to do it. Just tell me what I need to know so I can do my work. Fucking ay. This is going to be a trainwreck, and I'm going to quit or get fired over this. I can't handle it. The only thing I can do is not care about it. It'll go up in flames and I'll just have to take the L. It won't be me that has the most or a lot to lose. I need to keep perspective. The worst thing that this will be is a lost opportunity.

I had a good lunch with A and A. Tofu House. The food was noticeably good. I showed them the video of me dancing at G and R's wedding. I can't watch that anymore.
