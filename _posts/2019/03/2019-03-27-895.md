I was the only one at T2 again. There was a moment when I was waking up when I was deciding if I should get up or stay in bed, and I choose to get up, and thought it was a pivotal decision. It turned out it wasn't. Meh.

Cancelled my Tesla reservation. I want my deposit back. It, also, turned out to be meaningless. I can't afford it, and I have no need of it. I'll think about it later when I saved enough money.
