It got super foggy when I got out of the tunnel and it was amazing. My body instantly relaxed. I breathed in and soaked in the air. Fuck allergies.

Meetings are very often the least efficient form of communication. Work is going nowhere.

I ate a banana, did my curls, drank so chocolate soylent, and I feel jittery. I can't sit still for some reason. I don't know what's going on.
