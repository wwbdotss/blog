I'm tired and sleep-deprived I think. I had no energy at work. I had to sit in a huddle booth thing at work to get away from everything and the noise and light. The bad weather compounds the malaise.

I'm totally not going to go down and commute tomorrow. This is getting ridiculous.

Have nothing of note to record.
