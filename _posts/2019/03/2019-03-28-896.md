Worked from home. I finished all my meetings by 1 p.m. and walked to Stonestown. I ate a whole lot of junk. First, a really good Peach Perfection from Jamba Juice. I wanted to get another one after I finished it. Plain mee sua. A chicken samosa. Then I got back online and worked more at the library. Went back to the mall for more food. Got a strawberry jelly cup thing and a strawberry green tea with this salty foam on top at the bakery. Both those things weren't very good and I shouldn't have got them. Wandered back into the food court and saw the new chicken wings place had opened. I wasn't hungry enough unfortunately and just got some cajun fries. Next time. Szechuan boneless wings for sure.

I was also super hungry at dinner and ate more than usual. And still hungry now, drinking a chocolate soylent.

I'm waiting to pay the credit card to see the pending charges go through so I'm not starting the month in a hole already. This sort of thing is important to me apparently.

I rewatched the Matrix. Still my favorite movie.

I want work to be over with tomorrow and then I can do my quarterly accounting.
