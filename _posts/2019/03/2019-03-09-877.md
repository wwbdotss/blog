Allergies, bad, might as well be sick. Woke up late, at 1, after staying up past 1. The week of waking up early put on a toll.

Tossed away the bunch of clothes I had lying around for a while. That felt really good. I saw Norm from Tested. It's interesting seeing virtual people in the real world.

I walked back down and over to Lakeshore, ate bland noodle soup. Walked to the mall, saw a poster for an artic movie that I want to see actually. Maybe tomorrow, after I finish work. Got green smoothie with chia. Thought about getting pizza but wasn't hungry enough to eat the whole thing and didn't want to carry leftovers home.

Lonely is the word today.

Doctor said my glucose and cholesterol were all right. It makes me feel a little better but I still need to exercise.

Won a $20 gift card giveaway from the stream. I should have asked for a reroll, but oh well, I accept!
