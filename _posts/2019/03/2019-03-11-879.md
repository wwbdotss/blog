Bad day at work again. Makes me want to quit, like always.

The shuttle bus broke down in the middle of the highway. The driver panicked a little and didn't know what to do. The dispatch tried to talk her through it. He asked if she was able to start the bus, yes or no, but she kept giving extra details without answering directly. "The bus stopped, and I can't get it to start again. I'm in the middle of the road!" Then the radio started cutting out. "Come in, Jessica, base to coach, COME IN."

She managed to restart the bus and pulled over to the side of the road. Another bus picked everyone up, but dropped me off in a random Cupertino office. I took Lyft and made it to work on time.

Didn't see my bus so took another one. Didn't get back into the city until 7. I had to pee so walked toward the main library but it was closed. I went down Civic Center to go outbound but then decided I'd rather eat something at Westfield. And pee. So I did that. Papa Beard's closed only to say they're coming 2019.

I asked C to see Monet with me. Buying a membership. I actually like museums and classic art.

Spent the last hour and a half watching reaction videos of people unboxing loot crates. I crave *something*.
