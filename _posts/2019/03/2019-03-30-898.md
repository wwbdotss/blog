Typing on the PC. I still feel less cozy with it, especially for production. I use it all the time to watch things. It feels weird to type on it. And using the mouse is less comfortable than the touchpad. I very much enjoy the typing though. It's fun to use the mech keys.

I woke up at 11:30, which was great. I'm still lingering at home thought. It's 12:30.

I looked at my accounting again. I need to spend some money on myself. Just to do it. They are very much just numbers on the screen. I haven't really used money to positively improve my life. My clothes are tatters. I don't have a car. I just buy food because I don't want to eat at home. The last time I spent money on myself was my PC. Well, there are the trips too. So I do have these examples after all. I want to spend money just to spend money, for some reason. Out of boredom, probably. Nothing is moving in my life and I want to do something, anything. The real meaning of my balances, the passive one, is that I'm being responsible, and that meaning has lost its appeal to me a little bit. I want the other kind, the active short-lived meaning of buying something. I don't make sense. I just want to buy something. I also have the $20 Amazon card I won, so I will do that.
