Dinner with S was better than most of the others. There was one instant when the wine kind of kicked in and things were buttery. But like always, I feel like I'm trying to keep the conversation going. I spend the time trying to think of what to do next.

We ate at Zazie, which I didn't know was a French restaurant until she mentioned it. It was always the brunch place to me. We got chicken liver pate, which was thiccccc. Hella rich. I got lamb, which I didn't finish. So much meat. She got a seafood stew. Dessert was a strawberry and rhubarb crumble thing. The crumble part was just like pure brown sugar. The fruit filling part was good when I could find it. The white wine was very good. It was noticeably smooth and drinkable versus most of the other wines I've had. I might be a convert yet. I would drink that again for sure. For fun too.

I successfully bought her chocolates. It turned out the chocolate shop was not Dandelion. It was another one. The chocolates at Dandelion don't look very giftable.
