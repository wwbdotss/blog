My glucose is high 97. I need to exercise for real. I need to wake up early enough to make oatmeal.

Eating so much droewors. Too much.

Moved into new Apple office. Sleek and open and noisy. Form over function as usual. It's an extra 30 minutes to the commute, which is ass. I come back later too.

Reading the Andromeda Strain and the Raven Tower.
