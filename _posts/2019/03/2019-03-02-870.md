Dentist, ate ham and cheese croissant, half of a plain one, then part of the chocolate one. Then got mango green tea boba, which was really good, they had actual mango bits at the bottom. Also got tomato bisque and clam chowder at SF Soup Co. I finished the boba and clam chowder, and half of the tomato bisque. I threw everything I didn't finish away. Then Apollo 11 IMAX. The movie was great. The first shot of the huge rocket transport with threads, that was staggering. Then the launch and I was waiting for the bass and it hit hard. I leaned in and was feeling it.

After, full still of awe and a little dazed, I walked along Market and was about to go into the Powell station outside Westfield, but then I saw this shady guy at the entrance, and decided to cross the street to the other entrance. While waiting for the light, there was this loud pop and smoke came out of the entrance. What the fuck. I hurried across the street. Soon, cops and fire trucks and ambulances swarmed all over Market. Crowds formed with phones out. The station didn't seem to be closed though. I sent a picture and video to E about it. I got on the train and left. It turned out it was a fire cracker.

Ate the last bag of droÃ«wors, watched stream. It's late again.
