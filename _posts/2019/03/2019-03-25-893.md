I threw up on the bus, what the fuck. I knew it would happen since like Friday or something. My lack of sleep, stress, lingering allergy headache thing, long bus ride. Ugh. I knew enough to bring a plastic bag to puke in. Thankfully I made it into the bathroom in time. This is fucking ridiculous that I'm throwing up on my morning commute. This should not happen. This should not be part of my normal day to day.

I felt bad the entire day, through lunch. I felt better when I finished the last thing I needed to do today at 4:10. The bus ride back was fine. Tomorrow I'm not going down, so that's already an amazing relaxer.

Did not watch streams, but still watched it on YouTube, which was bad.

I decided to keep reading The Raven Tower. Why not.

S asked me to dinner for her birthday tomorrow. Her roommate cancelled on her. I will buy her chocolates, probably from the same place at the Ferry Building that I got her for being my reference.
