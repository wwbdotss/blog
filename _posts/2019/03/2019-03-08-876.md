Changed the wifi password because I saw a bunch of other SSIDs that I didn't create. Even if they aren't actually people stealing our wifi somehow, it still feels good to maybe potentially take that away from them, these hypothetical moochers. It mostly feels good because I did something about it.

Went to Safeway, got blackberries, blueberries, 5% full fat Fage, low sugar Chobani, tomato salsa sun chips, garlic hummus I'm going to eat with a spoon, dried peaches that I thought would taste different but just ended up tasting like dried apricots, and watermelon water with cucumber.

I'm going to do some curls every day.
