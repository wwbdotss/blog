I dreamt about gambling on Warriors losing in each round of the playoffs so I could have a consolation prize when they lose. I have no hope.

I walked to Hard Knox. That was a really long walk. I got an Arnold Palmer at Java Beach. It was pretty good. Not sweet. Lemon flavored tea. Streamline closed, which sucks. I don't want things to change. I can't handle it.

I cemented in my mind that the rock labyrinth is at Mile Rock Beach, on the upper trail.

I listened to Shardcast along the way. It was windy. I alternated my hoodie and cap. T texted me about the wedding and I wasn't sure what exactly she was getting at. I guess she wants to share an Uber?? I don't know. I need to buy my flight and hotel room soon.

At Hard Knox, I got a crawfish etouffee, mash potatoes with gravy, and those delicious corn bread muffins.

Took the bus back. So exhausted and sleepy.

Dinner with first aunt, grandma, dad, and V for dad's birthday. It was at the nearby Chinese restaurant that's stuffy and caused grandma to faint that one time. Food wasn't very good.
