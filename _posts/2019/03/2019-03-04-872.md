I skipped work again because I didn't want to get up for the bus. It's insane how much grip sleep has over me and dictate my life.

Finally went in for my blood test.

Got lunch at Japantown at a sushi boat place. Got toro, and really luscious salmon. Why do the Japanese not eat raw salmon again? Do they?

Then walked to Borderlands. Got the Raven Tower and stayed there reading for a while. I didn't know where to go. I prefer the mornings there. There in the afternoon made me feel like the day's been spent. I walked to Church and took the train outbound. Got KFC pot pie. I felt super hungry all of a sudden.

V is getting married and invited me out to Chicago. I had lots of feelings about it. After messaging back and forth, my feelings died down. I never felt like I was talking to her, really. I always thought that I could, but nope, the feeling of disappointment and wanting more, was the norm. I still think about what could have been if she didn't go out to Chicago. I would have asked her out, that I'm very sure.

I'm going to use the wedding for a nice week away from home. Hotel time.

The rest of my biltong came.
