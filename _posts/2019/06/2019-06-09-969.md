This is what I wanted.

Woke up at 10 a.m. to get the room service breakfast. It was bad. Two eggs and some sausage. Potatoes. Tea. $30+. Fuck that. It was worth me not having to leave the room for breakfast though. Barely.

I listened to music for a while, and didn't do much for awhile. Stared out the window. It was amazing.

Then I started watching Survivor.

Left when I got restless and a little hungry. I walked to the river, then the lake, and Navy Pier. Considered getting pho, or ramen, or boba, or burgers, but didn't feel like eating at a restaurant. I wanted to go back to the room and eat and watch Survivor. I bought $50 worth of expensive Whole Foods food, which I almost ate all of at this point, just some pineapples left, also not worth it but actually still worth it because it allowed me to indulge in social retreat.

I watched Survivor the rest of the day, and ate continuously.

So good. This is how a vacation should feel.
