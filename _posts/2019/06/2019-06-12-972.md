Finally unpacked, felt nice. Clean. I need a new travel backpack. Or a new commuter backpack that's only for the laptop. My backpack right now is too big.

I just asked if I can exchange it. Let's see what happens.

If it doesn't work, I'll try to figure something out. It would work as a single carry-on for traveling if I don't also have a rolling bag. It's too big for a personal item and I can't fit it under the seat. I don't feel good about traveling with it. If it were smaller, I would totally use it as luggage.

Work is like a scattered pattern right now. I can't hang on to it or keep anything in grasp. Go with the flow.

I felt great earlier this evening, felt steady and ready to spring up and everything is possible. Now, I feel the usual crappy again, the malaise and sluggish and that nothing will change. It's amazing how much the subjective brain can color and warp supposedly immutable objective reality.

Happy hour with B tomorrow. I feel a little better about it if I frame it as a curiosity thing, that it's a rare opportunity for me to meet someone new. I really am curious what it'll be like. It actually works to drive off some of the fear and social anxiety. Not all, but enough for me to use as a hand hold.
