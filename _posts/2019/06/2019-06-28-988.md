June accounting. Feels good. Didn't get my referral bonus yet though. When is that even going to happen. Annoying to have to chase after these basic things. Like the delayed 401k contributions.

Great lunch with A, A, and G. Went to eat at a Taiwanese restaurant with really nice new and flavorful dishes. Chicken clay pot and fluffy shrimp cakes. Then boba.

Then met up with H and others for burritos. We got Gordo's quesadilla burrito, ate them outside the botanical gardens, then walked around inner Irving. I should have eaten something else, but passed on dessert or more boba. It was so great to speak intentionally. It felt amazing. I think it was just because of the company. It's easier to talk to H and D and feel more in control. I just like control apparently.

Tomorrow dim sum with G, R, and C.
