The lavender milk tea kept me up pretty much the entire night. Also, my churning euphoric crypto thoughts. I felt horrible and didn't go to work. I was half working from the cafe then decided to hell with it and said I was sick and going offline. I walked randomly around. R and her mom saw me sitting on a bench and she called me and offered me a ride. I said no, and lied about going to the mall so they didn't have to drive me anywhere. But they had already turned their car around towards me. They waved and I waved. That was a nice coincidence. It happened before with H, when she and her mom saw me walking too.

Crypto has been entertaining. I'm getting flashbacks to 2017.
