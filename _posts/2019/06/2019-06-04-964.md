J is getting fired. What the fuck. This is really bad. I don't know what he did, but whatever it was, it better had been super bad. He is the best we had. My unfounded and cynical opinion based off of nothing is that my boss really likes control and me and J are easy to control, but J isn't. This is going to ruin the company. So much for that. I wouldn't be surprised if my boss gets fired for this in turn.

Bought black cons. I'm going to wear that to the wedding, I don't care.

Watched the Rainmaker movie. It's old.
