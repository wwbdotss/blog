Dinner with C was good. I had the spicy fish noodles with the fish on the side, that I can scoop into the noodles. She's going to Mongolia and traveling for the next few months. I talked too much about work, which is the only thing going on with me. She's pretending to be a tenant for her relatives to fake cash flow.

I'm also happy because crypto is up. Watching bitcoin hit $10,000 again (again) live is fun. Can't wait to wake up and see if it's still above.

I watched They Are Billions stream, which was what I wanted. Then I watched crypto videos and felt hyped.

It's 1:47 a.m. and I'm trying to take full advantage of Friday night.

Going to Legion of Honor with S tomorrow.
