I have a headache from watching too much Teamfight. Didn't do work like I told myself I would.

Lunch with family at closest dim sum place that turned into a regular restaurant, where grandma fainted. It's pretty good food now.

I can solve my problems through action. I have to act. If I don't do anything, I'm stuck with the same problems. It's not a hard concept to grasp. If I want things to change, I have to change them. Why is it so hard to do that.

I'm going to sleep hella early and I'm going to mess up my sleeping schedule from this side of it. Lame.

I can't stand my neighbors talking out in the backyard. Their voices are cacophony. Annoying as fuck.
