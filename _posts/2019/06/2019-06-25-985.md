I felt another jolt of pure happiness and sense of well being at first. Walking back home, full of Taiwanese street food and boba, crypto's up, didn't go home for dinner so no heed for time, listening to Odesza turned up. The weather was so nice. I didn't care about what happened or what's going to happen. I was just there, feeling good.
