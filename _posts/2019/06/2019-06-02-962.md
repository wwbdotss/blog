I figured it out. The one last piece from finish up the project. I figured it out in the shower. I led myself astray when I added a null check to the parsing. The null check used the unpopulated variable instead of the real payload, which of course would have the full URL in it. I could have solved this like hours ago if I had just better thought out the mock data and made sure it matched what the real payload would be.

It works, and I can go to bed without thinking. It's weird how I couldn't turn off my brain this entire weekend. It kept wanting to figure it out.

I snuck a peek against my better judgement and saw that the Warriors won. It worked out.
