Woke up. Ate a banana. Packed up. Checked out before noon and went to the airport by 1 p.m. or so I think. I had no interest in Chicago. I waited around and ate bad airport food and flew back to SF. Landed before 8:30 p.m. I didn't want to know the score, but the timing was such that everyone was talking about it. It was the first thing the Lyft driver talked about when I got in. I then had to check and have been doing nothing but read about that game since I got back.

I ate at King of Thai and got boba. Walking around in the warm summer night and the smells all around made me nostalgic for times I never really had. There was Davis, of course, but also of an alternate life when I stayed in China and walked around at night. It was a weird sort of thing to think about. Night life in Asia, I want more of that. That feels so right than quiet suburban city streets.
