Dim sum lunch with E. Then I showed him the office. I was the only one there again, and I was *so* lonely. I got nostalgic for the people who used to be there, and the bustle, and now it's just me. With J leaving, it's harder and harder to want to be there. It'll just be me and S, which would be kind of weird. I should really just go over to the main office. The situation just became awkward. I had said I wanted to stay, so I can't just suddenly say I want to go to the other office now that it's just me and S. That would be so terrible and I don't want to make S feel like I don't want to be around just him in a room. I don't know.

Saw Mono with V and her friend K. The show has a different flavor for sure. The new drummer is too strong for the band. I miss the old one. I've never heard the encore song before. It was super violent at the end.

Now sleep. Chicago tomorrow night.

E's coworker he referred to me to refer to HR got hired. Success! $2000 please. I can't wait to send $1000 to him over the BoA transfer.
