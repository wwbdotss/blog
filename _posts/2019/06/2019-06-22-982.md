Like most times I see S, I feel unfulfilled because I can't talk easily with her. I end up feeling hollow afterward. I paid at most half attention to the art; I was super focused on analyzing her every reaction. We ate at the first Szechuan place in the Richmond. It was just ok, like last time.

I got some boba out of habit; I hardly tasted it.

Crypto is doing well and I'm thinking too much about it. Such a waste.
