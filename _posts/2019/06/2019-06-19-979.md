Hating work a lot right now. Not happy at all. Nothing overtly bad happened. Just it being a normal day highlighted how the unadorned baseline itself makes me feel bad. In order for a day to be not bad, something good has to happen. If nothing happens, it's negative. The baseline is negative!!

Next week will be super bad. It's probably going to be the worst week at work.

I asked both H and C to dinner.

They Are Billions looks good. I can see myself playing and really liking it.

I wonder when they will give me my referral bonus unprompted.
