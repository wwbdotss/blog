I'm so sad that J left today. His last day. This happens every single time when someone leaves work. I get so attached to people, which is a good sign I'm not completely gone yet, and have *some* normal human emotions.

I want to ask C out. This has come back around again.

Dinner with dad and family. It would be nice.

I'm going to come back and do my new paycheck accounting. Then I don't know what I'm going to do. Youtube?

I can always write. Maybe it's time for that again.

I'm totally getting an impossible burger from Burger King.

Too many things are happening too close together. I haven't felt like I could relax for a while. I need a certain stretch of days without activity, some length of clear horizon. The last couple of weeks have been cluttered. I'm claustrophic, time-wise.

I should watch a movie.

Ended up watching streams.
