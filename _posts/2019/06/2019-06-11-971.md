Got out of bed before noon, which is a good start. I feel bad about sleeping past midnight and waking up after noon, so I should use make those into new rules.

I lingered around because it was fucking hot outside and first aunt had gone out and grandma was alone with me. First aunt made rice and left food in the rice cooker, so that was good.

I went to the mall to get my usual three courses. Green smoothie, mee sua, and chicken rice. So satisfying. I was going to leave soon after, but it was still hot as fuck, so I just sat on a bench and read more about basketball.

I have to wake up early tomorrow to go down to the south bay. It's going to be hella hot.

I dread going to happy hour with B. But I need to meet new people and should use that as an opportunity to find out about people rather than a reason to fear. I don't even know what I'm afraid of.
