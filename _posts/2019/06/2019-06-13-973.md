I didn't like meeting B. She's going to be tiring to work with and be around. She's smart. I can see her quitting pretty quickly. I think I knew instantly that I wouldn't like her when I saw her. It was like a split second and I formed a first impression that stuck. It's going to suck that she'll be working with A and me in the same project, with M too. It worked so well with just me and A.

It's my first take. It's pretty bad. I'll see what will happen when I actually see her more. My impression might change. It changed with A and A.

What's the next thing I'll worry about? Next week, just having to babysit everyone at work. M has no plan on the training schedule. We've just gotten inundated and there was no regard to how we will train everyone. I feel like we're going to get a lot of turnover.

I'm not going to think about work.
