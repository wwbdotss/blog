Dim sum, which was good. It's down at Skyline. I wrote a ragged paragraph. It's so hard to progress. I'm so close; I have to push through.

Work is dragging everything down. I feel dismal. I have to go down to fucking Sunnyvale for the next month. I can feel the life leeching out of my from here. I'm tired of training people. I'm not getting any work done. Everyone I'm working with is new and I have no one to rely on. I feel split like five different ways.

Crypto is down, and worse, it's boring and sideways, slowly bleeding.

I have to stop relying on these things for entertainment and meaning.

I might really just have one out. The only thread I could see to meet new people is to go back to Shut Up and Write meet ups. Or just something to do with writing.

I'm setting myself up to miss the bus sometime in the next month. Guaranteed. The whole scenario is so fragile. I hate having to depend on those two buses slots. I need to sign up for a rideshare to counter this problem. The worst thing is to borrow dad's car and get into an accident, which is so vividly possible, truer than true. It would be the responsible and forward thinking thing to do, just in general now, to get that car. Not for any fun reasons either, but in case I have to drive anyone to the hospital or whatever. Ugh.
