It was really good to work in the city. Felt so relaxed and good and normal. The contrast with the south is stark.

Didn't blog today again. Worked on stupid rush project. Stressing out about two presentations, but I tried to and sort of succeeded at mitigating the anxiety by downplaying both events. They don't mean anything in the long run and I don't care about anything. Indifference and apathy are so useful.

K suggested camping. So psyched. I was thinking about it after watching some YouTube videos. The food! I don't usually eat corn, but totally wanted to after seeing some cooked over a fire. E is onboard. L responded and said she would think about it. In other words, no. I hope to be surprised.
