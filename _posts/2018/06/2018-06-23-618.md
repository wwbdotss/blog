I was looking through Shroud's clips and stumbled on one where he raided a small musician. It's captivating to watch her reaction. She gained like a thousand subs that night. And I could see, even when she was being shocked by her good fortune, that she wanted more. She pushed for that 1000 subs. I see that look on Kate as well. There can not be enough subs. Insatiable. I'm going to follow this streamer because I really want to see how her numbers will change going forward. This data is so interesting to me. That raid happened a week ago. She has 1,600 subs now. I want to compare that to Kate's sub numbers that she's grinded out. Her stream feels like it's on a decline, and I wonder if that's a normal trajectory, or is it just her. Could the new streamer keep growing her sub numbers after that initial boost? She's doing it so far, which is impressive. I want to witness an inevitable rise instead of the inevitable fall of the sub numbers. I'm so tired of Kate's sub count dropping all the time. It makes me feel like I'm watching crypto prices. There's a helplessness there. Slow agonizing gains only to see them fall quickly. Every upswing afterward then feels temporary and illusory, all joy's sapped out knowing that they'll all go away like dust.

Give me something good to believe in.
