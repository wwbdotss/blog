Hated work. Very unsatisfying and I'm replaying everything I did and said and becoming hyper critical. It's bad.

Felt amazing walking home after getting dinner at the mall. Avocado toast and clam chowder, oh yes. Then some boba. They seem to turn off the wifi after a certain time? I got onto Gap's half-good network. The sky had layered clouds, some orange bursts sliding beneath feathery high-altitude wisps. The air smelled great. Not too cold, or hot, no glare from the set sun, perfect hoodie weather. My body felt great. I think it was the caffeine in boba. I might just need more caffeine in my life.
