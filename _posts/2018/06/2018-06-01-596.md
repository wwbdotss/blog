I'm liking my new co-workers more than I thought I would. I totally misjudged. I might still be misjudging since it's only been a few days, but I don't feel as stressed out by them as before. I respond really well to humility and lowkey chill people.

Dinner and sunset at the beach with S tomorrow. It has all the trappings of a date but is totally not one because I didn't ask her out.

I really like how I have nothing planned for tomorrow morning and can sleep in, but still have something to do in the afternoon.
