Watched Louis's livestream of his night bike ride through Spain. I kept asking in my head why he was doing all this, and envisioning all the places where I would not have made his choices. It's very cool to see what would happen if someone did choose the bad choices, and took the risks I avoid. It's riveting.

Car ride with J again. I talked more this time, and told him my own stories.
