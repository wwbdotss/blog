I had a span of clarity and good feeling when I was trying to sleep. Everything seemed possible. I've had these good feelings before and even when I was feeling it, knew it wouldn't amount to anything. It was so nice to not feel depressed and weighed down. I reveled.

I've been feeling sick a bunch of times in the morning before riding the bus lately. I probably have cancer. I fucking hate how this has become something else I need to worry about. Is my head doing all this, what the fuck. I made sure to drink something. My guess is that I didn't sleep well. The fuck.

Watching Survivor and the season's getting old. Probably the show is.

Bad dinner. I should buy more food.

No stream, no writing.
