Warriors won. I've been reading way too many basketball articles. I dove deep, free from knowing that the Warriors are winning. The final game was pretty anti-climatic. There was no excitement at the end, and now. It didn't help that they were in Cleveland, and everyone was hella despondent and occasionally booing. Curry didn't win FMVP, which would have been perfect. I've decided I don't like Kevin Durant very much. I don't dislike him, but he's not admirable.

I super look forward to sleeping in. It's the top two moments of the week. I need to arrange my life so I can sleep in every day.
