Doki Doki Literature Club is meta in an effective way. It's actually doing something with the self-awareness instead of just being smug abou it. The attitude and tone is right. There's restraint and consideration and competent execution. I like it a lot. When the game asked if it was being recorded and saying hi to chat, that was a genuinely acute, unexpected moment that got the reaction every creator who wanted to break the fourth wall in their art envisioned about getting. So good.

Kate is getting fatter. Appearances really affect how I regard her stream. It sucks. I have to work harder to make myself believe I could not care, but I do. I'm not attracted to fat people, and attraction is a big component of why I watch her stream. It's easy being shallow.

Whole weekend with grandma is so bad. I can't stand it. Her memory warps reality and time. It's as if things don't happen to her once she forgets. It's impossible to interact with her as a person. Memory is reality, pretty much.

I want to see the end of the Doki Doki stream.
