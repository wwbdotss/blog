I feel more depressed lately than usual. I don't know why, as always. Everything is meaningless. The future is grim, or worse, boring. I can't motivate myself to care. It's easy to be disaffected and indifferent. From this low perch, I can justify my nihlism all day long.

I'm sure I will catch the upswing. I always do. It's brain chemistry, right. I've given up on controling my feelings. I can get medication. I know. Will I change anything about my life, or will I just feel better about my current situation, even if there aren't any changes? That part I'm not sure about. Will meds lead to substantive, real physical changes to my life? I can't change my family situation. Meds won't make ether go up. I may write more, so that's one plus. I'm not that stressed about my writing though. I'm pretty happy with my slow-ass few lines every couple of days. I know I'm trying to weasel out of actively taking care of myself and talking to a doctor. But that's still not enough to get me to do anything. That's the wonder of depression. I'm not sure if there's even self-deception going on.

I need to cut my nails. Get a haircut. Call social security. All sorts of things I ran out of patience to list.
