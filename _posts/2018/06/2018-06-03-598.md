Off the Grid with G and R was good. Low key as well. It's good to know people and spend time with them. I don't have to be as on guard to perform. I still did, but it wasn't like the usual life and death.

I walked over to their house early at 10. I set an alarm and everything to get up. G gave me earphones, which was nice. Drove to the grassy area in the Presidio. Full of families and kids and people. Completely packed. G and R have this umbrella tent. Both kids. Had pizza, cerviche, chinese crepe?, lambic, alcoholic ginger beer, which I wouldn't prefer over regular ginger ale. I tried to avoid the sun as much as I could. We were there for almost three hours. It's definitely a place to go when you're with people. It would be the last place to go alone. It's weird that I keep track of that metric.

My shoe has a hole in it and it's gross as fuck.

Warriors won, so that's nice.

I have no expectations or dread for tomorrow at work.
