I felt really alert and nice during my ride back on the bus. It's just now that I realized what it had to be: the green tea I drank. It's magical. I should do that all the time. Get caffeine.

Work is all random. Something is going to happen because this isn't going to last.

I hate how I agreed to go back down south tomorrow.

I love Goldfishes cause they're so delicious. Gone Goldfishin'!
