I got really into the Death Stranding trailer and lore. The concept is the most unique and thought-provoking sci-fi thing I've encountered for a long while. The first time I saw the trailer was just confusion, but the intrigued kind like when I confront a crisp mystery. Then I read about timefall and everything ramped up. So great.

Father's Day dinner with dad at the claypot restaurant. Good as usual.

Friday night! Saturday morning sleep-in!
