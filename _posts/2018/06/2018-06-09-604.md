Tired all the time, feeling rushed. I read all day at the Blue Danube. Started and finished The Forever War. I'm so over the same boring perspective of old white men. Sci-fi sucks because of that. I want cool speculation of cultural and social changes in the future as much as technological advances. More so.

It's almost 1 and I'm so sleepy but I don't want to surrender.
