Exhausted from training people. I don't like it. It's hella tiring to narrate what I'm doing. I can't concentrate, and everything takes three times as long to do. Webex can suck it. Training two people at once in a stuffy conference room is the worst thing ever.

No stream today so I wasted the evening even more than usual.

Tomorrow, I will buy some purple mouthwash. That's the only thing I need to do to create some semblance to productivity and progress.

I watched the best porn yesterday. Korean. The girl was so good-looking. Then today, I watched the same video and was turned off at the end when I realized how fake her body was. Her boobs were totally implants and I didn't notice how unnaturally they stayed up. I can't watch that video again.
