The sunset walk with S was pretty good. It was so nice and so much better to *be* with someone. I felt so lucky that I wasn't alone at that place, at that time. You really don't want to be alone for a sunset on the beach. I would know!

I still can't with her. Not really. I don't think we have anything in common. I don't even know enough about her to say that we don't have anything in common.

Dinner at Outerlands. Mid-expensive, thin dishes. It's the sort of place where you don't really come out full. Their bread and butter are good. I had a fish dish. Three pieces with a nice soft-boiled egg and random potatoes to fill out the dish.

Then she drove us to the main parking lot. Walked down the stairs to the path overlooking the baths. I didn't know there was a sea rock with a hole in it. We went around and back up to the trail. Golden hour. The little beach you can get down to from the trail was so good. It was the best part for me. There were a bunch of people down there taking pictures and getting ready to burn firewoood. Stacked rocks were everywhere. The enclosed curve of the cove was perfect. That is now my favorite part of Lands End. I need to go back there with a date. It's one secret place I know now.
