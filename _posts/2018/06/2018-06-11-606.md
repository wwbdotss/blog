I was so stressed out for no reason about going down to Sunnyvale today. It's bullshit. I jolted myself awake at 5:45 and just kind of lay there gripped with tension. It's like a flashback to when mom was sick and I would wake up hearing her in pain. I really don't want to go over that ever.

I'm not getting work done with the training. Complaint.
