Got a raise! Haven't written anything for a couple of days. Lots of work. Feeling weird after compliments and prizes. I value myself much lower than apparently other people.

Got the Tesla order email. I can pay more now and have a better chance at getting the tax credit. Or wait and actually get the $35,000 car that was promised. I don't want to pay for anything extra. I don't even care about the self-driving stuff until it actually happens, and by that point, I wouldn't want to own a car. It would be a service.

I don't want to sell any crypto, it turns out. I'm so attached to and value crypto much more than cash or anything I could buy with it.

I should still sell though, for the psychological boost knowing that I bought a Tesla with crypto profits. That's satisfying.

Watching over grandma this weekend. Dad and aunts going to a concert in Reno, which is great.
