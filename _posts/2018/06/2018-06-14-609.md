Nice day at work, being back up in SF makes all the difference. It only took that. Validation and cool weather.

Chatted with V after months. Nothing has changed. She just disappoints me a lot in conversation. She doesn't give me what I want. It's a bad expectation. I have snobby high standards for conversation.
