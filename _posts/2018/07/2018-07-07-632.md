Shepherd's pie at cafe. Green tea. Good. Took my time doing the timesheet, then watched Kate stream. Went back home mid afternoon and watched more stream while writing a little. It's a good groove.

Got V's package. She mailed me an underwear travel bag, which was weird but interesting and useful. She also got me a book, which I skimmed through for plot points and it wasn't very good. She quoted the Stormlight Archive in her note to me, which was unexpected. I didn't know she read all the same books I did, that our reading history was so similar. Chatted a little. I don't feel that close to her, and everything ostensibly seems good, shared interest, her caring enough about me to send me things and write encouraging notes, but yeah, I don't feel the connection. She's just a good person, and it has nothing to do with me.

I don't feel secure with money. I don't know how to make myself feel secure, or what that goal would even be.

I need a haircut, but I need to work tomorrow too. Hm. Richmond library?

I had a good talk with dad in that I told him about my raise and touched base to know things are normal. It's really hard to gauge how we each feel because we're both so taciturn, and these little talks reassure me things are ok.
