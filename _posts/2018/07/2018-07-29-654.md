Oatmeal at local cafe. Chia, milk, honeydew, strawberries.

Then I thought I should really eat something more substantial and wandered along Taraval being super indecisive and anti-social. I did not want to interact with people in any way whatsoever. I drove myself to walk to Stonestown, even though I was really hungry and just wanted something quick so I could retreat back home. There, got a green smoothie and a Blaze pizza. Trudged back and realized the Stern Grove concert had let out and hordes of people flooded the sidewalks all around the area I needed to get through. Fuck that. I walked down and around, miles out of the way.

Home, Pillars til 2 a.m. It was bad.
