Nice easy Friday.

I asked S to dinner tomorrow. I needed to feel like I acted, to respond and react to real events instead of all my imaginary scenarios and hypotheticals. I got what I asked for. I feel so insecure in myself. I had no plans or idea what I'm doing here. She said yes, but asked me if there was something up. Nope, I replied weakly, I was just around the neighborhood? Eck, I'm embarrassed but also no regrets whatsoever. I'm glad I asked her even if my reflex is to immediately doubt and self-flagellate. I like this sort of mentality. I can really do nothing wrong because I'm so psyched that I'm actually doing it. Anything is better than not doing and speculating how life will turn out. I had already won. This is the kind of thinking that will keep me moving forward. I dig it.
