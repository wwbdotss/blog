Watched Sicario 2 with S and her friend. I still don't know what to think. She still thinks a lot about her ex. That's natural I guess. I want to ask her out more of an exercise than anything I think. Am I attracted to her? Not especially? I like her looks. I like that she's driven and smart. I'm not sure I like talking to her that much. I don't feel much when I'm with her, aside from the good feelings I get from the generic societal approval of hanging out with a girl all afternoon. That's really flimsy, irrelevant, and ultimately meaningless. But it feels good at the moment and for my memories and self esteem. Why can't I feel something real.

She showed me her app and asked what I thought. I went through it and nodded and made encouraging noises. I showed interest just because of her. The app could be whatever.

We ate lunch at a pizza place. Then the movie. Then Pete's. Then cheese tarts.

Hate having to wake up an hour early tomorrow to catch the stupid bus when I don't even have to be at work for an hour. It's bullshit.
