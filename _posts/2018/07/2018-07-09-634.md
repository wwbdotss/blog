Things are just bad. There's no time anywhere in the day. I keep working until 9 or 10. On top of that, everyone at home is freaking out about my cousin's behavior. It's so vague and indeterminate exactly what he did. Aunt feels threatened and dad thinks his reactions are weird and he's uncontrollable and people are talking abstractly about it. What the hell. They asked me to call the police and of course they can't help because no one can give me a straight answer as to what is going on.

And on top of *that*, I forgot my charger and didn't realize it until I had 23% left and I can't check things as much as I wanted to before I sent out another test.

I'm so fucking frustrated.

I made sure to go out and get boba with A before she left. That was the most important thing for me to do today. Work was not going to take that away from me. It almost did. We met up at 4 something.

I should have gone back into the office afterward and finished my work instead of coming back home and dealing with all this crap. I would have finished earlier in a better environment, and would not have forgotten my charger. Bad decision on my part.

I should have passed the project back. I should have pushed back against the other random stuff that eroded my time. I'm throwing up my hands, this is so stupid.
