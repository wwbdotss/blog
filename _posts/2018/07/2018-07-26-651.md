Feeling comfortable at work. It feels so nice up in the office, away from the south bay. Tranquil.

Bitcoin below $8000 again. lol.

Hot pot with C and E tomorrow. Will be good.

I'm going to try to wake up an hour early and see if I can get any work done before the onslaught of Friday meetings and distractions.
