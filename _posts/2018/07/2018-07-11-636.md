There was that moment when I found the extra } and everything cleared and whooshed down the chute. Damn that felt good. It's the rise from adversity and earned success comes from. All around was bad, then you spike up and stand on a higher place.

It's extra great because now I can see a stretch goal and glory come into view. I have a chance at a greater, more visible victory where I don't just get by, but be notable if I can pull it off. The QA person said it would be highly unlikely there would just be one round of testing. I want to prove him wrong and win accolades.

Waking up at 5 a.m.
