Pho with S. It was fine. Nothing bad or great, or happened. I don't know if I would ask her out for real. I got no data. I'm glad that I asked her to dinner and initiated a meeting. I'll leave it at that.

Got a haircut. That was the highlight of the day. I feel neat.

Coworker texted me about work and I was like WTF, I'm not thinking about work over the weekend voluntarily. Fuck that. I was so annoyed.

More sleep.
