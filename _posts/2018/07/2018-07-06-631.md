Early bus there, late bus back. Worked like fucking 14 hours today. There's just more bad things on the horizon too. I hate dealing with other people's code. They should lie in their own bed.

Went to dim sum with A and other coworkers, which was nice. I "revealed" that I could speak Chinese. I got some chicken feet. I think I'm becoming more accepting of myself maybe.

I just want to sleep now. And also blog before I get too far behind again.

Tomorrow, regular cafe route? Haircut.

I didn't find the time to eat my burrito in the fridge, which is now gone to waste.
