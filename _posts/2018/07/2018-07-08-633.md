Super productive today. Felt good I figured out the proxy link for Yahoo. Got down to single digits in the inbox. I'm just anticipating a bad bad week ahead. I'm going to try to keep perspective and flow.

Dad being weirdly paranoid of my cousin is more worrying to me than whatever my cousin's up to. Lock the doors and use the other entrance to avoid him? What the fuck? Is this a preview of what happens when dad starts to get older? Fuck.

I'm so looking forward to going into the SF office tomorrow. Suck it, south bay.
