Crypto is way down. This is so interesting. I'm living it. What's going to happen.

Second aunt and uncle are buying a house and moving out. Fourth aunt and cousin are moving back to Hong Kong. Changes. I think I'm still going to be just stuck in my little room. I have no control over my life.

Didn't play video games today, so that's a plus.

I asked about my raise. Where's my money!

I need to find a cheap haircut place below $12. The previous place I go to for $10 raised their prices.

Another month is over and I have nothing to show for it. A chapter of the book I guess. Few more numbers in the bank account. There's no progress or development. I didn't join the bouldering gym. I didn't go to meetups. I didn't ask S out.
