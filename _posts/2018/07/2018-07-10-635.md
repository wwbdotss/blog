Much better today. Got work done. Good lunch. Things felt cohesive. I felt comfortable. Family was neutral. Not having to panic automatically makes it a great day.

Bracing for tomorrow though. And the next day.

OK family still bad. I'm missing so much of the picture. And being so passive while everything is happening around me. They're thinking of sedating cousin?? What the hell is going on. None of their whisperings make any sense. We're on the verge of violence.
