Success. Passing QA felt amazing. I was putting forward all my mental will for a favorable future. That hour was hella tense. I was hopeful but didn't want to get my hopes up, and put some pessimism on, but I really wanted to win. Universe, just let me have this one. I stared intensely at my inbox. I could see the PASSED subject line so vividly; just give it to me.

Then, I got it. It was such a clean spike of happiness; I could see for miles around. All the good things I hung on a favorable result instantly became real. I didn't have to pat disappointment on the back and comfort it. No. Fuck that. I got what I wanted.

No matter what happens next, I had the moment. It feels so great.

I then lay down and didn't do anything. I didn't even nap, I was still so pumping and coursing with adrenaline. I just lay there reveling in not being under stress. It's probably exactly what I would do if I won the lottery.

I then took a walk to Lakeshore. Got some mango flavored apple cider vinegar and "San Francisco" potato salad, and walked back.

So good.

Tomorrow will be tomorrow.
