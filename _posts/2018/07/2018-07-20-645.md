K is back from the hospital, and I don't feel as safe at home. It's kind of fucked up. I really can't stand crazy people. Even a hint of mental instability turns people into non-people for me. I despise not knowing what they're going to do at any given moment. They are outside the bounds of normal conduct, and the unpredictability scares me. This is one trait that would make me into a great supervillain.
