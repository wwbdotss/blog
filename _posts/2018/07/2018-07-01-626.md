Such a big relief that dad and aunts are back. I don't have to watch grandma anymore.

I'm very sexually frustrated recently. Probably because of DDLC. I think how I'm wasting my prime. I need to go out, and meet people, and find a girlfriend. I'm tired of being lonely. I'll ask S out and see if there's anything there. I don't care if I'm misreading signs or whatever the fuck or if I really like her or not. Asking her is the only way to find out for sure.

I need to buy a new nail clipper.

Sleep.
