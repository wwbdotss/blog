I didn't do anything at work today; it was so great.

I get more joy out of building my characters in the game than combat or the story. That part's great and I actively want to do it. Customizing the attributes and skills and talents and all that, that's something I could do forever. It's the same vein as building my blog, or designing a book cover, or sketching out a map, or worldbuilding, or financial planning, or tinkering with the Sublime Text settings and preferences, or customizing the Windows desktop. It's this idea of setting up an engine, and optimizing it, that really attracts me. How could I do that for a living?

I had been looking forward to seeing my paystub this week for the entire month now. I give it 50-50 that they had actually processed it today. I'll check anyway. I'm prepared to be disappointed.

More Pillars.

OK, just checked and I didn't get the new rate I was promised. What the fuck. Not disappointed, pissed. Now I have to put in effort to ask about it and chase it down.
