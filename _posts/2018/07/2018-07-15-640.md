Day of watching Grandma. Turnip cake, salmon and roe fried rice, and wonton noodle soup from the corner diner. I gave in around 2 in the afternoon and napped. Fuck Sunday afternoons.

Watched Kate's cooking stream and it was so cozy and wholesome and everything that I wanted. If that's all I have, good people, cooking and eating together, I mean, what else do you need.

Wrote some.
