I didn't take the capital city, but managed to capture another little one. I'm fine with it. It made me realize how much more I like building to expand than fighting. I love scouting out new locations to settle, then lining things up with everything in sync. Much more satisfying than the best parts of domination. Warfare genuinely stressed me out. Most of that's probably because I'm playing on Diety, for the first time too, but eh.

Doing more Javascript. I actually built a table generator like I wanted. Not too bad. Now I need to know what people use Javascript to do most of the time.
