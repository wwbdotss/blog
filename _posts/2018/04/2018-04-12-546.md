Ate out. Had just ok bun bo hue at Golden Star? Golden something, above the park in Chinatown. Then Starbucks. I watched stream and worked on work, actually. I super enjoy the control I get from starting from scratch. No dependencies I have to manage. Just clean straight effort.

First aunt is going to be gone for a month. Grandma is going to be a lot of handle.

Super hungry today. I didn't eat much. I don't know why I just don't go and get something to eat.
