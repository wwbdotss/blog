Going to see Avengers with G and D. Making plans is the highlight of the day. Something social is happening.

People donated more than me during the stream and I feel diminished and less good than before. These feelings are irrelevant to anything, neither to be acted upon nor given any more thought nor assigned more meaning. It just emphasized how fleeting the feeling I wanted to cultivate was and how ultimately pointless my donation was, and the feelings then were only good then, and not for anything else. I fully knew that 100% and am not surprised at the deflation today. Matter of course.

Got into a deep dive into Xenogears music boxes. I became instantly awake. The dream is to get a custom Sanyo one.

New version of Small Two of Pieces! More expansive. I like it.
