Feeling good today because!

Kate mentioned my name on stream today. A very nice stream showing the new 4x4 jungle map. There weren't squads, that would have been perfect, but it was still very good. A part of the attraction of a public figure and cults of personalities is the good feelings the audience has for their devotee when good things happen to them. It's a really compulsive and compelling force. I feel like opening my wallet and giving them money to cheer them on; the draw is so effective.

Wrote some more, and like magic, thought up a good approach toward deciding what a rake is.

Work is a little less uncertain, still uncertain but I can see a way through it. I have to fix the Windows 10 Mail bug, get it passed QA, and then hand off to Content. Then no more worrying about it until the testing bugs come in. I need tomorrow to happen my way.

First aunt made really good porridge. V was home. And it was a nice wholesome family dinner.
