Woke up late, I think I stayed a while watching something? It's only been a day and I don't remember anything. My memory is so, so bad. Everything is blurring together. Partially because there's nothing memorable that's happening in my life. Nothing worth remembering, so my brain is auto-deleting the trash.

Anyway, after, I went to Stonestown to get Blaze pizza. Then pairing that with the usual Jamba Juice. It was good. Got a weather-proof shell from Uniqlo. I want to try it out in the rain. Dinner with first uncle at the crappy place on 19th and Taraval. 63 health score, lower than even Little Henry's, unbelievable!

Civ until really late.
