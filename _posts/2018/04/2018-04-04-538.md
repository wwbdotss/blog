Deposited $900 from relatives paying me back.

Played more Civ until late.

Good day at work when I got QA approval, and my PTO approved. Friday looks really bad and I'm super glad I decided to take it off. Bad as in lots of meetings and interactions with people. Dev meeting. One on one. All hands. Meet and greet. Going away happy hour. Ugh and ugh. I'm getting away with not going to at least five things.

Ready Player One tomorrow.

I love how I set things up. It's like the start of a weekend after work tomorrow. I can watch the movie, knowing that the next day is free, then the actual weekend. Good and good. I'm proud of myself. I'm going to play more Civ and try to beat my game for sure. It's definitely at the appropriate difficulty level for me. I like feeling ahead. I like Wonders. I like having enough money, and military units, and built-out cities. I should see what the game's like if I crank it up to max difficulty. How many turns can I last.
