Went to the SFMOMA with E. I think I've had enough of the place. It was lackluster in the dim evening and scarce crowd. I never really have what would be a normal conversation with E. It's kind of a bunch of short remarks passed back and forth. I noticed it does get flowier after a while. Ate Indian food.

It's going to become May, then June, then August, then the year will be over and I'll be in the same place. Will I actually finish Part 1 this year? If that's all I do, I think I can live with myself. It's a really significant mark of progress. And yet, I didn't write today. OK, I just wrote like half a paragraph. Good enough.

Sleep. Tomorrow, finish my work.

Tempted to check crypto but won't.
