Typical dim sum, but the annoyances were stark today. Just dealing with bad communication and large-group circumstances. It all worked out at the end. This kind of pattern is becoming the best fit for my life right now. Probably not the working out at the end part.

I need to get out of the house and away from grandma. I need to feel like I have to ruin my own life to offer any value to the family. Suffering is not a currency.

Finally went to Planet Granite. It was harder to get there with that 14-minute walk down from the Golden Gate Bridge parking lot. I can't imagine myself doing that two times a week. I can more easily see me just taking the T to Dogpatch. I feel better there too, being a bouldering-only place. And cheaper. So many good reasons. I think my mind's made up. Yup.

I'm going to plan my day off at the end of this week, after I finalize the stupid email and hand it off. I'm going to watch Ready Player One, and Borderlands maybe? Slow walk up Santiago sounds nice. Through the park. Richmond lunch. Then movie. It sounds so good.

I need to plan my train trip. That would be so so good. I want to wake up at ease instead of panicking and stressed out. It has to be a week. Train to Denver and back. A couple of days at a nice hotel there. Exquisite. If I want it I have to get it. Make another Oregon memory.
