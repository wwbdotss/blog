It's more peaceful when I don't watch streams right up to bedtime. The time to ease into things and to settle in and take liberties, time padding, is nice. I got to write a little just at first and smooth out a better direction to take with the heroes and how they react to certain people. It feels more in tuned with the character.

Now to watch some Slice of Matt. It's the perfect time.

Pizza for dinner today. V got them. So full. Dad asked me yesterday how I microwave my potatoes, and did it today, which made me feel useful.

Crypto down again today. I really shouldn't check again for a while. I'm going to aim for not until May.
