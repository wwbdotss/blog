Didn't blog today. Slept late because of stream. It's bad.

I don't remember what I did.

Oh.

Finished reading The Last Equation book. It was meh.

Then I tried to stay awake against the late Sunday afternoon. It was bad. I worked out. I tried to write. I checked crypto. It's rising and fun again. Two days up. One down. Then two up again.
