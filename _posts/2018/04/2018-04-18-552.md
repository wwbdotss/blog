Going down south tomorrow, for one meeting. It's not important or necessary at all.

Finally set up the appointment with the pest control company. It's not going to work with just one treatment. The roaches will come back guaranteed and the tenants will ask me to call them back, also guaranteed. There's no way this can get fixed like that. Two times, no. Three times? Chances are, I'll have to ask another company. It's how I view the world. I can't imagine thinking otherwise, or thinking the easy, best thing would happen, that they would fix everything and I don't have to deal with the problem again. That doesn't happen.

I won't say anything or display any kind of positive attributes during the meeting tomorrow. It would be a net negative day.

I'll be super sleepy because I won't be able to fall asleep until 2 a.m. or something, even if I sleep now. It's how things work. I know the future!

I need to get a more detailed receipt from the dentist. I'm not going to send over the insurance company's claim details. It might work, but I don't want to deal with uncertainties if I don't have to. I'm so sick of it all the time.
