Lunch at corner diner with grandma and dad. It was good. We ran into three sets of people who knew dad or grandma. It was really neat. Perks of being social. Again and again, it's apparent that relationships and connections with people are the most important things in life.

Wrote and watched stream. It was nice and effective. I managed to finish a section.

I needed to leave the house to get some air and exercise. Walked to West Portal Starbucks and got regular coffee with regular sugar. Walked back. Dinner at King Wah for grandma's birthday. Two tables. Half the restaurant was sectioned off for a wedding banquet. Good karaoke singer towards the end.

Back, Civ until late again. I will only play if I wrote that day. Simple.
