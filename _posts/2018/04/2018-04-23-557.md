Interviews at work. Liked one of them. I doubt she'll accept.

Tomorrow will have nothing going. So looking forward to it.

I need to sleep before midnight. Watching streams is not worth it.

My skin is molting.

Exterminator finished the first round. Now I just wait until the roaches come back. Over and over again.

I need to buy something salty. I'm so tempted to get more beef jerky, but I'm afraid of cancer.

I'm so hot in this room. I think it's the PC heat.
