Checking crypto and it's so easy for it to disappoint. Can't have  good news three days in a row.

Slice of Matt is my favorite YouTube channel now. So wholesome. Casey's videos all seem so pointless, given the promise implied in the new thing he's doing. It's so much talk and not much difference.

Regular takeout Saturday for grandma's lunch. Kingdom of Dumpling is not that great. I don't think I've ever really really liked it. Walked down. Took the bus. Got off at the park this time and walked through it to get the itemized receipt from my dentist. Bought a book and finally used up all my store credit. Juice and chicken thin sandwich from Blue Danube while reading The Last Equation of Isaac Severy. The words on the cover "A novel of clues" sold me. I really wanted to just buy a book and not think about getting it used, or on Amazon, or reserve it at the library, or any of that shit. There's the book, just buy it and read it. It doesn't have to be complicated.

Watched streams. I'm expanding outside of Kate's channel. It's nice to see people who are better at PUBG than she is.

Ate cereal. It's 1:30. Time to oversleep.

Also learned what an au pair was.
