Super agitated. On the surface, it's losing at Civ and not being able to do what I want. Nature has rebuffed my will.

And that surface irritant triggered the usual shit: I'm stuck living at home when I really, really need my own space and not be around my family every single day. Mom's death. My insecurties at work. Me not having a girlfriend and losing all my friends and being on a declining trajectory in life. Just checked crypto and it's even crappier than before. That didn't help at all.

Why is it so hot?
