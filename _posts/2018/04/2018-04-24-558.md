So the daily movements for the past few days since I started checking again were up up, down, up up up, and down today. That's a signal for me to stop checking. It's totally going to tank for the next few days. I like to check when I'm depressed.

Dental receipt thing done and done. Exterminator done for now too, so off my mind. Texted S about Sunday and she said she was looking forward to it, whoo! I won't ask for her to pay me back, but if she offers, I'll accept. I don't want to send any signals. I'm pretty sure she doesn't want to start dating so soon after her break up. I thiiink she said as much?

Anyway.

Hopefully tomorrow and Thursday will be the same as today. I just want blocks of time to work.

Bought cheeses and chips. Looking forward to getting hungry later tonight. Youtube.

Was super stressed in the morning cause I gave grandma her medicine when there was doubt if dad had given them to her already. I should have played it safe. I did it to close out the task. That was what was happening inside my brain.
