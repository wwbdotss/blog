Got mad because FSA card denied my receipt. I was so indignant. Then I understood because my receipt said previous balance, which could mean anything. I will need to get a better receipt without that nebulous line item from the dentist. Now I'm not so mad, but still want to be.

Didn't play Civ, so it's still just 11:19, which is great.

Called around for exterminators for the tenants' roach problem. I did not sign up for this. I hate doing landlord things.
