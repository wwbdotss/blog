I'm just miserable. I couldn't control myself and watched hours of Magic streams. Went to Christmas dinner at R and G's house, and felt the same sense of failure from comparing myself to everyone else that always happens after these get-togethers. The same fucking walk back. Why can't things be different? It's so fucking boring feeling the same things every time. The answer is in my inaction to do anything about my situation.

And tomorrow is fucking Sunday, and then I'll have to go back to work.

I also need to feel like I'm eating what I want, no more exceptions for crap to gain weight. Then work on regular exercise. Those two things will be the very baseline of what I do. I have my default health that I didn't work for right now, and I can't depend on that forever.

My biggest problem and weakness and thing I want and need to improve the most is my social relationships. I suck so bad and I'm lacking in every way that relates to people. Family is the source of most of my stress. I have feeble and weak friendships I don't find fulfilling. Work relationships are so bad and also not what I'm looking for. I have no one to talk to, like really talk to. I feel this way and don't know what is true. I may have someone I'm overlooking of course. I just can't find the energy to nurture relationships so I just think they all suck.

Warriors lost and crypto is still down.
