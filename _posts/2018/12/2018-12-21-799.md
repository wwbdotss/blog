Made it. I have nothing to do now.

I can write. Read. Play game?

I just want to sleep in. And eat biltong.

Oh, Survivor's done. Time to binge!

I'm going to check crypto for sure.

I super want to tip a lot to streamers. I have extra cash, which I haven't felt for a while. Tipping will destroy that feeling, and inevitably end in regret. I still regret my tipping bender last time.
