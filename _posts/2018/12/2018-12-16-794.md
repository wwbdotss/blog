Another bad Sunday. It comes from first aunt not being here. Grandma gets on dad's nerves and they argue. I'm stuck in here listening to all this. I wake up at noon and couldn't leave in time before dad cooks lunch. So I stay and eat bad lunch. Then I stay so dad could go out. I then answer grandma's repeated questions. The day winds down, and dinner becomes the next problem. Grandma would keep on taking food out of the fridge to prepare for dinner. I don't know how she got stuck in that loop. I hate that dad would have to cook if first aunt doesn't come back. I feel helpless. Then first aunt comes back and everything is all right.

Fuck this noise.

I have to wake up early to go down to Sunnyvale tomorrow. This is bullshit as well.
