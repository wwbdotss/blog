Things are as normal as I can hope for. This will be the period that I'll look back on as a pretty OK time. It's very easy to take this period for granted. I'm staking my gratitude right now for what I have. Things are OK. Things are good. Nothing is really bad. I'm not wanting. Not suffering. Whatever happens next, happens.
