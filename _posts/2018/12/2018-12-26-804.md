Christmas over. The break is on the other side. All downhill from here.

Playing Civ again. I'm shameless.

I stepped out when I really needed to get some sun and air. I walked to Stonestown. Pizza and green smoothie. I looked for a dot grid journal but couldn't find any. I want a Japanese stationery store.

More civ now.
