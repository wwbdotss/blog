Super regular off day. Walked down the street. Then I remembered I should do new things every day, and turned left instead of right. I ended up at the mall anyway. A sewer burst or something because the entire place stank. I got out of there and went to another plaza instead. Ate sushi. Bought groceries. Home.

Played a lot of Civ.
