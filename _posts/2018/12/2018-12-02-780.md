Wrote a bunch in my journal at Blue Danube. It felt good to write with a pen again.

Another reason I like winter and fall is the short days. I keep thinking it's later than it actually is, and feel really great as a result, like I just keep gaining time. It's only 7:30 p.m.

I opened my work laptop to find out if I have to go down to Sunnyvale and I don't so alright. It relaxes my evening by a lot.

I also wrote for a timed hour, and that's definitely given myself permission to slack off guiltlessly. This is like the only way I can enjoy things. It's not so bad I guess. It feels clean.
