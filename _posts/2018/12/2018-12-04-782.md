I'm so lazy at work. Watched Twitch there. The gall. I was indifferent to work or helping people do work.

I'm totally not going to write today. My streak lasted two days.

It rained! So that was good. Got groceries. Lots of random food. I'm most hungry after work during my commute, and just before bed.
