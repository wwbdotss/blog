Stopped playing Civ from playing too much and just tired of it. Until next time.

Can't care less about work. I'm going to do something stupid and get fired.

I heard that a cousin will be giving birth soon and I honestly don't give a shit. Anything about babies, whatever. Could not care less. The really bad thing is that I feel so *good* not caring. Society can bitch all it wants, but nothing can make me care.
