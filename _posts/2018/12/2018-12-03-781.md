As good of a moving back to work day as I could have hoped for. It was good. Nice and easy, didn't have to be down in Sunnyvale, that was the biggest part of it. I didn't have to deal with random people. It felt nice to be in the office with people I know. Also, didn't do any work really. I liked sharing my vacation pictures with people at work.
