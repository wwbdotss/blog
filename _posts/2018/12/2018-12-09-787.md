Dad probably threw away my orange New Balances not knowing they were mine. I'm thinking whether to just buy new ones so I don't have to bring it up and he doesn't have to feel bad about it. Of course, it might just be that he stored it somewhere else, but I have no idea why he would do that. He threw it away once before thinking they were mom's, and I retrieved them from the garbage bag.

At Starbucks, blogging. Mocha, it's been a while. I'm going to write.

I want a burrito. It's 4 p.m. and a good time for me to eat. The Sunday afternoon miasma is hitting. I have to wake up early to go down to Sunnyvale for stupid meetings which could just be an email. Two more weeks until Christmas vacation. I should enjoy these weeks. As sucky as I make them out to be, they're infinitely better than the weeks after the vacation. It's just a desert plain, stretching far away.

I am so super ultra relieved when first aunt comes back home to take care of grandma. Without her, I don't know what to do, especially with dinner. Dad would cook and I would feel guilty about not helping because I don't know how to cook. I want to just buy take out but dad would refuse. So despite being abled, I don't help at all. I hate myself for being so useless and helpless.

Boss texted me and said he moved the meeting tomorrow and I don't have to go down to Sunnyvale. YES.
