Wanted chicken katsu curry but didn't want to hang around Japantown after work. The commute back home from there is pretty awful. I went to a place at West Portal. It was ok. Expensive though.

I read a bunch of Murakami at Starbucks afterward. I really like it. I feel very comfortable with the story.

Bought Spiderman ticket on a whim. I want to see new animation. Graphics.
