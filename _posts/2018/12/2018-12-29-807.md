At Danube. The days are flying by. I don't know how to slow things down. I dread going back to work.

I don't think the planner thing is really going to work out. I'm so particular about writing in it, so precious, that I'm going to mess the layout up. It's adding undue pressure. So weird. I think it'll be fine. I just have to relax about it.

I seriously didn't know what to do with myself throughout this entire break. That was the theme. I wandered around aimlessly. My thoughts were all over the place too. I don't know what I want.

I got some pho at first just to eat something. I woke up just wanting to escape and leave the house, especially before anyone else came back. I walked, also not knowing where I was going. My backpack got heavier. I didn't have a good reason to bring the backpack, either. Nothing was planned. I brought my laptop, a Murakami book, soylent, and my puffy jacket. I'm using the laptop now, so that's something.

Walking with no destination in mind is fine. It's a good time to listen to podcasts. The Acq Inc Halloween special was great, and I'm glad I still enjoy it.

I leave the house so I could get that homecoming feeling. I have that now. It'll be great to go back home and settle in. Watch streams. Youtube. Play games. Read. Eat junk food. Then just sleep. Everything to be grateful for. Three more nights.

Just the chai today.

I have some five spice chicken spring rolls, and it's too weird. I'll stick to the classic shrimp.

No more Civ plz.
