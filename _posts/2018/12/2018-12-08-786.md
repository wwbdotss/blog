Spicy V8 is the best.

Woke up late. There was only three hours of day light left. Eh. Saw G and R at the mall, which was nice. That was an event. Got mediocre expensive sushi and shrimp dumpling things from a new place. That was after I got oyster mee sua, which I had actually looked forward to. Red guava drink too. Then after Stonestown I remembered I had some queso and got some tortilla chips at Lucky's and a strange aloe drink that didn't taste very good, plus that spicy V8.

Magic streams for the rest of the night I guess. Plus queso!

The queso and store brand chips weren't good at all.

I watched the USS Callister episode of Black Mirror. I liked the premise. Was that Sarah Silverman?

Wrote a little today. A little quiet scene, backstory kind of scene after all the action. I liked getting into the sentence level.
