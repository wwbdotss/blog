Biltong came early last night. I ate too much. My teeth are weak.

I went to the dry cleaners for the first time. Being productive. It feels good to get rid of the bag of shirts in my room.

Streams and half-started Civ. Ate more biltong. Tomorrow, I'll do another singular thing to pin the days to memory better.

Crypto is up. Warriors won. That's fun.
