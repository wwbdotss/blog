Civ. Sunnyvale. Ate lunch at Hopee's with J and T. Random sweet potato hashbrowns that weren't hashbrowns at all. Blue cheese overpowered everything. The veggie scramble was fine. I liked that S said he appreciated me commuting down there. It's free for him to say that and effectively nudges me away from quitting.

One more day of Sunnyvale tomorrow, then coast the last two days.
