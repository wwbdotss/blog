Woke up late at 1:30. I was watching Survivor until 4:30. It was super great.

It rained, also super great. Went to Japantown to buy V canned chestnuts. I felt good.

S texted me to ask how I'm doing and if I had plans for the weekend. VO also IMed me and we chatted a little. Human interaction feels so good. I don't do it because of fear.

Finished Survivor.

Have to get up early tomorrow for dim sum on Christmas.

I think now that my only hope is crypto when it was writing, before.
