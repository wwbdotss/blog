Dim sum. I feel so out of touch with my family.

I'm at home to watch grandma again.

I'm typing on the keyboard to be different. This does feel better. Back straight. I've lifted up my forearms off the table so they are hanging above the keys and I'm lifting and lowering from the elbows to assist my fingers. It's like I'm puppeting. Or I can lower my wrist down, which feels more strained, but I seem to have more control and it feels more solid. I wish I knew what the most ergonomical setup feels like so I can adjust accordingly. Is this how it's supposed to feel?

I've been eating biltong and droewors nonstop since I got them last Friday. This is really not good.
