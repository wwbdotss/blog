I'm dreading the new person starting at work. There's something about him. He's definitely more affable and friendly than me, and cooler. So that will make me look bad. So it's just a net negative for me at work. Sucks. I instantly reached this conclusion when I interviewed him. It was inevitable, and I hated the whole situation, me, him, everything.

Dad also tried to set me up again. I'm sick of that whole situation too. He's trying desperately to help, and it's the absolute last thing I want. I can't get that across, that I don't want anyone to help me unless I ask.

Sleep.
