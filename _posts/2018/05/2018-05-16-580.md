Sick. Stuffed nose. Throat hurt for a while. Headache. Fatigue. It didn't feel like the I'm-never-going-to-get-better feeling from the flu, so that's the good part. It feels like a special exception to my life and not part of it. I'll feel better tomorrow.

Warriors will lose today. Then probably not even get to the finals. It's the easiest thing.

Going back to all lines being downward sloping, why does it feel good to elaborate about how shitty my life is headed? It absolves responsibility to keep trying? Not quite. It's something else.
