Walked a lot, from the beach to the panhandle, then back to Fulton. The 28 was fucking awful. I got to remember never to take it on a Sunday. How could it be so bad.

When I got back, I collapsed into bed and even endured a nap. The main problem was the headache and pressure. I didn't care about the fatigue of the body; that's not important to make me do anything.

I texted K to see what he's doing, and asked about Japan. I don't know how to follow that up though. Ideally, I would call him and talk about it. Or even naturally segue into planning my trip down to visit him. I just left it hanging though in the text conversation.

I DMed V and I still romanticize my online past with her. I don't know how we could connect; I don't think I ever really knew her. She's a concept and words on a screen. I do want to know her. I really like our history. It can be a relationship I restart and actually try at. I'm tired of seeing things fray.

I tried to avoid finding out who won the last game, but my CEO offhandedly mentioned the loss in an email. Then I found out Cavs won, and so the pressure is all on for the Warriors. They will fail.

Because I lumped not-checking crypto prices with not-checking basketball scores, now I feel less resistance to checking crypto. I should just give in. Buh. Did it. It's just bad. Regret.

Nothing came from being on-call for work. Hovered around and no texts. All good then.
