Kate's stream is losing lots of subs lately, and it's such an interesting thing to follow her ups and downs. There is no certainty of success or failure, and anything can happen. My usual pessimism isn't ringing as confidently.

I'm doing dumbbell curls daily and seeing if that makes any difference. It feels nice to feel in control of the weights. I don't feel like I'm struggling against it. I can add more, I suppose, but it feels hella good now to handle the 35 pounds. I like the old consistency too.

What am I going to do with this weekend. It's going to be another long stretch of time I'm going to waste.

I'll finish the book. I'll write a little, probably finish the chapter. Watch some streams. Lands End. Cafe. Golden Gate Park. Richmond. Beach. Starbucks. West Portal library. Parkside library. Danube. Borderlands. Where else do I even go? I should climb this weekend. It'll be a memorable event pin.

Sleep is going to be the main event I'm sure.
