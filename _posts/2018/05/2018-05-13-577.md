Made it to Borderlands. Cute cashier. Read Dance Dance Dance for an hour or two. They removed their food menu. Got hungry and left. Passed a pho place earlier but it was after 2:30 p.m. now and they had weird instructions to go to another pho place around the corner to order and dine in?? Not dealing with any of that. Found another place, pretty much deserted, ate fast and a lot. Kept reading at West Portal until it closed. Home, stream, packed.
