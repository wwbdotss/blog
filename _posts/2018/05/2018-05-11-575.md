Work lunch went as expected. Lots of upkeep to my face. I was on stage and keeping up a performance more than usual. Throughout I was thinking I need to get through this without doing anything or having anything go wrong. It's representative of how I go through life. I hate how something so simple and normal turns into a battlefield and arena in my head.

Something is going to go wrong during my week off. Guaranteed. I have no confidence. Then I'll turn it into all my fault in my head and amplify whatever bad things happen. It's my way.

The New York trip is definitely another example of this. I just want to get it over with and hope nothing bad happens. Everything is reduced to a survival scenario. I can't, then, enjoy anything that is happening because I just want it to be over.

Played Heroes til late late, 2 a.m. Hated how I couldn't help myself. I still feel the tinge, the draw, to play more now, the next day.
