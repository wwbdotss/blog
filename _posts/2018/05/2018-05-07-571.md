Watched more Amazing Race and I'm not so hung up about the mixed race couple anymore. I've stopped projecting myself onto the guy and see them just as other people. There is no extrapolation about my insecurities or anything. I'm approaching how normal people would actually perceive them. I'm not even really cheering for them to win. I like the snowboarders more.

Super normal day. Didn't check cryto price on my phone. I did see the charts from opening the browser again at work. I'm going to maybe give it a week and see how I feel.

Biggest concerns now are the Follow Up email and the New York Trip. And the Friday lunch. The three things I'm dreading.

Hype is selling the side crypto at the end of the year, and the train trip to Denver I need to plan. It would be awesome. The single moment when I'm alone in the hotel room and I can just strip off all my clothes. Freedom from external regard. So good.
