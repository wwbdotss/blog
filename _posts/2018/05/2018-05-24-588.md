I super consciously chose to go down and actively decided to do it, the entire way. It was mixed. Nothing too weird or extreme or regrettable. I got sort of what I wanted out of it. And the rest was just susceptible to regular variance of being around people. Glad I exercised my will and actually did something, and acted, against comfort, but that wasn't an enjoyable thing, and given a consequence-free choice, I would not have chosen that over doing nothing. It did not cross the threshold.

I couldn't think straight. Three times I spoke randomly just to speak and fill air and I sounded like an idiot. I kept serious track of that shit.

Pizza was good. It was nice to be seen that I cared enough about someone to go down there. It was good to see how people behaved. I got a better sense of everyone, which is useful to know, to increase my knowledge of people. I like A more, for sure. She seems like the only capable one who has got her shit together.

The shuttle rides both ways were just bad, exhausting long wastes of time. I felt my life force draining from me. I couldn't concentrate or do anything on their but endure the lurch and crawl in traffic.

I'm going to play Heroes now and no one is going to stop me!
