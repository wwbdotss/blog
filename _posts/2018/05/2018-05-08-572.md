Finish watching the Amazing Race, and my least favorite team won. Buh.

Reading Dance Dance Dance on the train. I like how I don't know what's going to happen.

Work is going to be ongoing and there really isn't a natural stopping point. We're so slow.

The rest of the week is going to go by so fast. Then I have to survive the New York trip and hope to make it through intact. I'm so looking forward to it being over. There's just so much that could go wrong in my mind, the gains are nowhere near the risk in my evaluation. Super epically not worth it. I'm just doing it to produce memories of family time I can look back on.

The stupid Follow Up email is still lingering because the tests are outdated. It's going to keep going and I'm going to keep getting more tickets. Forever.

I didn't check crypto prices the entire day. It just feels so easy to give in and check. It's a really bad addiction.

Warriors won, so at least that's something. I'm too stressed out by the possibility of watching them lose to watch the games. It's so weird. It's like definitely saying something about me. Why am I so invested if I'm too scared to watch the games?? Am I just finding pleasure from the results, the aftermath, and the main event doesn't even matter to me? It's messed up. I should just fucking watch the games, what the hell is wrong with me.
