Today felt good.

Planned a dinner and Lands End with S. It's weird because it's not a date and I don't know how to navigate this. I don't know if I want to ask her out for real, or just keep hanging out as friends. There's the same communication issue; we can't really talk.

Warriors actually won, so fantastic.

Stream was nice. Got more writing down.

I tipped Kate some more, to an even number. I still feel OK about it. It's a much better stopping point for me to stop tipping. At least that's what I tell myself. Lol whatever.

Crypto is down, but down to an interesting level. Anything is better than a slow bleed.

I'm on a high.
