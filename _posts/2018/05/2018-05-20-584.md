Warriors won! I can enjoy a day and bit without worrying about that part of the universe.

Going back to work tomorrow. I have to figure out what story I'm going to tell. The truth? The aim is to spend as little time explaining as I could.

I'm distilling down Heroes. It's all about the Hero and not about the victory conditions. I need the Hero to be exactly how I want them to be. That's the game right there. I can't relax or enjoy the game if the Heroes I'm using are slapped together with random skills. There has to be intent.

My throat is still a little scratching from whatever. I'm blaming the pumpkin seeds, which I will never buy again.

Lunch today with dad, V, grandma, first, second, and fourth aunts. It was good. Then I spent the rest of the afternoon playing Heroes. Did some curls and sit ups though, so that's something.
