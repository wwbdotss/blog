The new version of Small Two of Pieces is actually exactly the same as the old version. Buh.

Watched the bootleg concert. It's so interesting to see the Joanne Hogg, twenty years later.

Ate out today. Went to a downtown Starbucks for a change. It was not that great. They were closing in less than an hour and the countdown agitated me. Smelly person changing clothes and stuff as I walked in. Went to the West Portal branch library to watch some streams then started working and gathering my to-dos and consolidating emails. That felt good and I'm ready for tomorrow at work.

King of Thai. I was the only one in there for the majority of the time. Watched Warriors-Pelicans Game 2. Got excited and rushed back home to watch the rest. We won, which was nice.
