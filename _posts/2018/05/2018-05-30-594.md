I feel like I have no time when I have all the time in the world. I feel harried and hurried and always running late and behind. I don't know how I can naturally fall into a better rhythm. If it's not natural, I can't sustain it. Actively trying to keep something up doesn't become habit for me; it just keeps being hard and draining.

Kate's stream today was bad. PUBG war mode is anti-PUBG in every way and annoying to watch.

Loose ends at work. Not enough time for projects. Way too many projects and demands at the same time. There are no good results coming.

Sleep.
