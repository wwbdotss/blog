Super bad combo of Heroes and streams. My attention was so erratic and I don't know how I wasted three hours and I got nothing out of it.

The bug tickets I was worried about are in a good place I think. It's not my fault. One of them got closed. Then I looked at the other and a new problem came up. There was a moment when I checked my work and found it fine, that it was working as intended, I immediately felt the cascading salve of relief over me. It made right the rest of the day.

I've given no headspace to the trip. Not prepared at all. Random things are just going to happen and I'll be bumpling around. I'm too tired to care.

Sleep. It's 1:30 a.m.

Tomorrow is the stupid lunch. I don't want attention.

There was a charge on my credit card today that I didn't recognize. It was a $20 purchase from the Google Store, which is really weird. Maybe it was something auto-renewing or something? But I have almost nothing that does that, save for my bus pass. Well, that set off me getting an expedited new card in the mail because of the trip coming up fast. Should be here tomorrow. Hassle.
