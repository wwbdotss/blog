Woke up at noon. Oatmeal at cafe. Then chicken pot pie, which I have been looking around town forever for. Mel's no longer has it. It's never there at KFC when I ask. I don't know if Max's is still in business.

Teriyaki seaweed snacks are kind of bad. The sweet part is not good.

I had the best surge of joy at the cafe when Kate's stream came on and it was multiplayer Stardew and I just hunkered down for a couple of hours relaxing to the banter and comforting farm noises. I half-wrote and ate pot pie and the world was good.

Reading a thread about the OP being homeless and things snap into a stark perspective and reminder that I should be grateful for everything I have and don't take them for granted. I don't know what I would do differently though.

I'm on-call tomorrow for work. What the fuck.
