I hated the crush of people on Fridays at work. I physically feel the revulsion. Then I step back and have to let indifference take over; it's a dependable coping mechanism. It can't hurt me if I don't care about it enough. So I tune everyone out and focus on maintaining my silent coccoon of comfort at all costs.

Avengers tomorrow with G and D. Going to be great! I actually look forward to it. It's so nice to be social with people I know and feel comfortable with. That's a good sign for me. A barely good sign. I'm not totally lost. I actually enjoy human interaction as long as they are people I like.

Stayed up to watch a coding stream of all things. It got me excited and motivated to code and do things. Coding is an expression of will.
