Starbucks. Kate stream and half writing. Think I got sick there. Burrito. West Portal, but I sneezed a lot so I left and went to Parkside. Sat there for the longest three hours. Miserable. Home, got into bed right after dinner. Couldn't sleep though. Got up to shower. Read NBA. It's now past midnight and I should really brush my teeth and go to sleep for real.

All my lines are downward trending. Except writing, which is really nice in that it's cumulative by default. And maybe my 401k, if the long-term productivity curve maintains.
