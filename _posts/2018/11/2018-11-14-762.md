Work sucks. Instrumental rock does not. This Will Destroy You had their moments. Overall though, they don't try for cohesion or storytelling. Their songs just do whatever. I can kind of understand. They are choosing to please the audience in less obvious ways I guess.

S being there made everything better. Glad E joined too. Sharing experiences with people is a good thing. It thrilled me that she took pictures. I told her about the violinist and she was like oh! and took some pictures. I was concerned that she would be bored or not like it. Eh. I don't think she liked it. She said it was nice (?) that she got to see a different side of me tonight. Took a Lyft home. I spent a lot of money today actually. I paid for drinks, the show, and the cab. I don't like roping people into something like a new band they're unfamiliar with. They said yes to the invite as a courtesy to me. I'm learning this from the time J took us to try out the crappy fish and chips place and then paid for us because he wanted to take the whole burden of the risk of a new thing that he invited us to, that we didn't initiate ourselves. That is really fair.

V bought me the mango Shubert mousse cake I'll bring down tomorrow. Just did that to check that off. Not much value for me other than to say I participated. Work is going to be bad regardless. I took one of the later Van Ness buses up today.
