Not going out today. Well maybe later to get something to eat.

Did chores. Felt good. Cut nails. Was going to call SSA to report an error and they already fixed it on their own. That was the oldest email I've been putting off in my inbox.  Super nice to check that off. Watered plant. Hung shirts. Stored away the APC finally. Did my timesheet. Had oatmeal. I think that's it. Super productive.

I'm going to use the skull as my symbol. Fuck Chinese censorship.
