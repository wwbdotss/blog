Stayed home today to watch grandma because the cut on first aunt's foot got infected. It seems like drugee cousin is just going to hang around and just go home to sleep. For now, I guess.

I did some push ups, dumbells, and sit ups. The minimal. And edited a bunch. Confirmed that S and E are coming to the concert with me on Wednesday. So nice, all those three things are super good.

Seeing grandma and grandpa tomorrow.
