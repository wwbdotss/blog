I need to send a production test, then ideally a tech test, get a cake to Sunnyvale, then figure out what to do about the BBQ. I can dodge it by going down to Sunnyvale again and say I have to work more closely with people. Then it's train time. I need to just make it through. Oh and I also have a concert to go to, and make sure I meet up with S ok and have the evening go nicely.

Sleepy.

I bought some biltong yesterday, and it's now on top of my looking-forward-to list.
