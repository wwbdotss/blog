Stayed home to watch grandma. Edited some more. I'm just going to polish my chapters and not change anything. I'm tired and really want to finish and get this out.

Exercised a little.

Don't want to go to work tomorrow because of the unknowns surrounding work that has ambiguous ownership. Annoying as fuck.
