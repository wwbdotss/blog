K drove us to ramen and someone rear-ended us while we waited to merge. It felt like we ran over something really crunchy. That's what it feels like to be in an accident!

Made it to the end of the week at last. I watched streamed afterward. And my jerky came. I didn't eat any though. Too tired, fell asleep.
