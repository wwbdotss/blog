Bad morning on my last day. Woke up at 1. I'm so disappointed in myself and the universe.

I really like staring outside at the rain. Storm, preferably. Even really cloudy, the kind of with dark gray angry clouds, calms me and I couldn't look away from the window.

Oh good, the heat kicked on.

It's a depressing day. I saw it coming, but failed to change it. Waking up at 9 something would have made all the difference and changed the situation 180. But instead I have two and a half more hours of daylight.

I watched Psychokinesis. The last one, Train to Busan, had the same discordant rhythm and unfamiliar cultural messages and tropes. Not into it. Or it might just be a bad movie. Or I might just be racist.

The trash cans in the room has no plastic bag in them. That seems kind of gross for the cleaners to deal with.

So grandma will live in the basement. I'm going to be trapped in my room forever. I'm not surprised how shitty external events around me continue to be. I'm relieved she will be out of the hospital. A lot of the relief comes from me not having to deal with the hospital situation. Most, probably, because I'm so fucked up.

The vacation is over. I've lost the sense of safety and tranquility. The horizon is gone. Now, my whole body is just all on alert and bracing for the return to regular life and work and reality. It's been good. I liked this break.
