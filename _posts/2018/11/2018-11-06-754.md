The fuck. I've been eating the same dish for lunch for a while at the same place and I got totally food poisoned. I noticed it seemed oilier than usual. I don't know. I think that's what happened. I recognize the feeling. At first I could pin it to boredom and the dim light inside the office and general malaise about work. Then it started reminding me about the time I got the flu. I put my head down. That should definitely be a signal for the future that I am sick and should leave work. No way was I going to go home on a bus; I learned that the last time. It was a horrible ride. Rush hour traffic. Everything jolted. Maybe I've reverted to being carsick again after not driving for so long. I just made it. I got out of the car, said bye, and threw up on the corner. Mushroom chicken noodle soup all over.

I lay down in bed and shivered. I thought everything was fine and ate some porridge and an apple. The apple tasted amazing. Then I felt like throwing up again. What the fuck. I went down to the basement bathroom and made myself throw up. I got back into bed and still felt dizzy and wanted to throw up. What the fuck again. I think I might have been able to keep it down if I cooled down some instead of making myself throw up. I was hella nauseous and I didn't know why. From overheating? I don't know. I threw back some covers and felt better, enough to sleep. I had no conclusions about what the hell was wrong with me.
