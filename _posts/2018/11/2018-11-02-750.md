Got oatmeal at Rolling Out. Jessica Ho had a elections thing there too? I didn't know what the point of the meeting was. Carmen Chu and other elected people were there to talk and cheer lead. I still don't get it.

I edited a lot though, so that was good. I then walked to West Portal and edited some more there until it closed. Black bean chili and fries. Hella full.

Now watching streams and basketball.
