I woke up and wrote my out of office email. No way was I going to get on that nauseating bus for ninety minutes. I felt bad about not working. Oh well, whatever. I'll just get fired.

I got up at 1:30 in the afternoon and made some oatmeal with jam. The first few bites felt bad, then it seemed fine. I hope I make it. The goal today is just to not throw up again.

Drugee cousin is coming today. I don't want any more shit to weigh my mind.

Watching streams, and intentions to write.

I also don't give a shit about the election. I'm waiting a week for the clutter to clear out of my feeds.
