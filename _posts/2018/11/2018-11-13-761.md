Three more days. I have to make a text version. Send PT. Then get to the concert in time. Then get the cake down there. That's it. I'm staying away on Friday from the BBQ, so one less thing to worry about. Three hurdles. Three rivers.

Good sleeps on the bus. No dizziness. It feels awful to get off the bus on 19th and it's dark. Bleak as hell.

Wrote a little. A rainy morning scene.

Air is still bad.

I hate the interview process, on both sides now. It's the whole judging people based on a few minutes with them. I can't do it.

Cafeteria pizza is great. Ate and talked with T. Maybe I should do laser eye surgery?

I think it's the most normal I feel since I got sick, at this very minute. I think I have my appetite back. I can imagine eating and have an urge toward it, instead of reeling back. Hunger is the best signal for my health.
