Woke up dreaming that I looked at a clock that said 12:19 p.m. and felt bad that I had overslept again. Then I woke up for real and though wait and looked at the time for real. 10:59 a.m. Ahhh, feels good.

Got a text from A and I instantly thought something had happened at work. It was just A checking up on me and I felt relieved and also bad that I had assumed the worst and should have known that A would do something nice like that. Then J called and it was about work. I was primed for it though so I wasn't bothered. That's a good tag team.

Today is open and bright.

Walked to Shake Shack. It wasn't good. I didn't have the appetite and the burger was too greasy and salty. I tried the mushroom burger I was going to save for later, but it also wasn't good and I didn't bother taking it back. The shake was ordinary. So much for that.

I'm sick of thinking about food and getting food and planning what food to get. Went to Whole Foods again to get another one of the purple sweet potatoes I like so much. Got juice. Mango chunks. Full fat yogurt.

It always feels great to come back to the room after being outside, even if I didn't do anything outside. Homecoming.

I crashed asleep on the couch for twenty minutes? It was terrible. I was trying not to mess up my attempt to rectify my sleeping schedule.
