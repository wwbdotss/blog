Day off tomorrow but I haven't told anyone at home. I'll continue to live my life of deceit.

I reflexively hate people so easily, like J's friend at work. Instant annoyance and utter judgement of him. I was the one who objectively acted unfriendly in the situation because I ignored him and put on earphones, and he didn't do anything.

I bought After Dark for V, so that's something.

I don't like people who talk.
