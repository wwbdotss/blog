I took a nap at 2 something in the afternoon and it worked. I didn't sleep, I don't think, maybe for an instant, because I remember snapping awake again. Then I felt great. Refreshed. It was a two-hour nap, or lie-down, as it were.

I want to speak without reference. No internet speak or stupid catch phrases from online. Speak plainly.

It's a mystery if I would sleep tonight. Shuttle bus tomorrow will wreck any normal schedule.

I want some fruit right now. Got back from family dinner at Jumbo, really early. It's not 8 p.m. yet.

Dim sum with grandparents went OK. At New Asia. They only spoke about me not having a girlfriend. It was still OK. They don't seem to be aging. I wanted to take a picture, then didn't want to, and should probably have. Oh well.

Eating Pocky and watching streams now.
