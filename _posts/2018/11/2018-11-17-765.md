Good lazy day. Well still did stuff. Worked, even. I had to get the project handoff right. Timesheet too. Annoying, but I didn't care. I was free at least for a while. I played Civ and watched streams. LittleBigWhale is great. Ate a lot of the biltong and droewors. Good. Mild with vinegar. Going to eat some more. I packed intermittently too. I'm finishing the mango mousse cake. Everything is great. I'm getting up at 6 tomorrow.
