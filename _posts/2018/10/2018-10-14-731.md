Someone's completely blocking the driveway. There was room behind them but they pulled up all the way up to the next car. I don't understand what they were thinking or saw. I want to tow them so hard. Second aunt told me to knock on the neighbor's doors to check if the car is theirs. They have a broken bell that says to knock, but how the fuck can you knock on a gate? It's the very type of weird turn of events I feel I encounter whenever I meet a crisis. There are always these little compounding things around the edges that make things even harder. Aunts took the bus to Noriega instead to get the cemetery offerings and told me to leave a note for now and see if they are still there in a few hours. I'm a bundled up ball of rage. I'm sitting here and waiting, and can't do anything in the mean time. Who is this person?? I feel no compassion or fear. I will tow the fucker.

This is really interesting turn of events. It's J's car! Of course. The universe isn't outright malevolent like this. The worst thing I could have done is to tow. It's so interesting. My aunts' discretion was the right thing to do, to give the person the benefit of the doubt and to check around. I was just blinded by rage and indignation. Love it.
