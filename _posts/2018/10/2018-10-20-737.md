Got out of bed at 1 p.m. Ate oatmeal with some jam mixed in. I took my time. Ate dinner with G and R for G's birthday at Chapeau. It was too heavy. I feel gross after eating all the meat. I'm super sleepy for some reason, it's only 8 p.m.

Lunch with S tomorrow! I'm looking forward to that. It's not going to be what I want it to be, again. I have to ask her out, what am I doing.
