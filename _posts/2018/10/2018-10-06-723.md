Oatmeal, shepherd's pie, green tea at cafe. Watched LittleBigWhale's stream and she's so great! Super good at PUBG and has a good personality. I like how she speaks French. Her stream is more enjoyable than Kate's.

Walked up to the edge of the park and back. I liked the physical exertion.

Organized my backups, it was a mess. One less thing to worry about.
