Ate at Shihlin again. That is impossible to remember how to spell. The mee sua wasn't as good as last time for some reason.

The shuttle bus back was so bad. There were no seats. I had to sit in the back seats that faced some back facing seats. I had to sit skewed off to one side the entire time and contorted to fit with the other two people there. The worst.

I have no streams or youtube to watch. I'm listening to a crypto podcast on speakers now. I will just read the rest of the night. I put in a few paragraphs for the draft, so writing done for the day!
