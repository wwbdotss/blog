I went to Stonestown to get pizza for lunch and bought clothes, then stayed there waiting for dinner. E cancelled though, so I bought random things at Lucky's. Half-sized vegetable party tray with ranch dip that I like so much. Safeway's is better. Dublin cheese. Blueberry kombucha. It was a dark and depressing walk back.

Then first aunt tells me we're going to the cemetery tomorrow, early. Fuck. It's past midnight now and I'm playing Civ and refusing to sleep. I hate everything.
