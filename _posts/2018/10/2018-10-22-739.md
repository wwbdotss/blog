Good day at work because nothing happened. I met the new receptionist and I could tell immediately we don't have much of a rapport.

I have to go down again tomorrow. F.

Reading Sphere, which is good so far.

Editing some more. I'm just going to go straight down the draft. I'm not going to bother shuffling things around. That is how my process will go.

I submitted my expenses for the hotel and car. Just give me money.

The lotto jackpot is $1.6 billion, which is nice. I got a ticket on Sunday. I didn't realize my last ticket was all the way from July. I'm going to have to buy another ticket after this one; it'll be hard to avoid news if someone won.
