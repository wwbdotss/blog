Peeked at crypto. Boring. I'll use that to keep away.

Returned library books and skinny jeans; felt good to check those off. I cleaned my closet a little too, which was also nice.

Borrowed a Robin Hobb book. I'll try to read her again.

Grandpa called and invited us to eat but I messed up the dates and told him that I was going to pick up dad at the airport. Whoops. I don't want to go anyway, that's the truth.
