I got promoted!

Letting the feeling run through me.

I told E and S. Before, I would have told C and perhaps VO first, but things have changed I guess.

This is as relaxed about work as I could get. The promotion is a plumb injection of objectivity approval. I'm as far from getting fired as I could get.

Eating fruit mentos.
