I don't know when I gained my reflexive revulsion of seeing Halloween families trick-or-treating. I can't help it. I can't stand scenes of wholesome families and kids.

I made bad decisions and ended up walking toward West Portal, which was overflowing with trick-or-treaters because of the rich houses in that area. I was going to go to Squat and Gobble, but took the L right out of there. I should have gotten off the shuttle bus at Stonestown. I ended up eating at the Chinese place across from the bank, on the same block as Quickly. It had a big super colorful and graphic menu that was hard to parse. I ended up choosing a spicy noodle soup that I didn't realize had coconut milk curry thing. Bleh. The mango pudding and hot soy milk were great though.

I had a bad day at work because I compared myself to J and I found myself inferior. I spent, and still spending, time trying to talk myself back from the despair. He's a better worker than me. Double bleh.

In that despair, I reached out to E and VO and A on chat, wanting that human connection for comfort.

I ended up distracting myself by watching basketball and streams. I wanted to do that with writing, but that doesn't stand a chance against the easier and slothier alternatives.

Just have tomorrow be normal and I can slide into the weekend. I'll try to make the most out of Friday, which I get off, and not think about work.

I will now eat some honeydew that first aunt left for me in the fridge.
