I checked out and went to work at 11 something. I told A that I didn't sleep and she said oh is that why your eyes are bloodshot? The day went by in a haze. I finally left at 3:30. I was so sleepy during the drive back. I imagined if I had to drive my boss up in the morning and had to make conversation; I really dodged a bullet. I returned the car. I made it. Everything went according to plan and it was all I had hoped for.

Ate dinner with V at nice small and hidden kaiseki place in Japantown. Sake miso was the standout.

Lyfted home. I finally slept.
