Playing Civ again. Oh no.

S is texting me about her app's logo. I'm glad for the attention, but I know it doesn't mean as much as I want it to mean.

I felt sick toward the end of the bus ride today. Sunnyvale is just getting worse. The close cafe with the good salad is gone. Worse and worse.

It's raining!!!
