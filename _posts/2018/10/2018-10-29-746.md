Crossed off the two things on my dreaded list today. Survived. The kick off meeting was super not anything to be concerned about. It was nothing. As I rationally knew, but still assigned way too much significance to. S didn't even show up to watch whatever I did in front of the client. Nonevent. Picked up dad fine at the aiport. No deaths via car crashes.

Felt good. Just relaxed. Spent the night reading about basketball and enjoying the commentary about Klay Thompson's 14 threes.

Post-river meadow-living is the best.
