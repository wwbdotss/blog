Bad day because I perceived it so. Hated driving people to second uncle's birthday dinner way out of the city. I have to go down south tomorrow for no real reason, once again. The combo of the two fucks me up. I have no respite with a clear horizon until tomorrow evening. The final thing is I can't figure out where my bites are coming from. At work?? I have no idea. I'm itching all over.

This hour or so right now is so good, dinner thing over, just a night of sleep immediately ahead, only mindless streams and journaling presently.

Get today and tomorrow over with.
