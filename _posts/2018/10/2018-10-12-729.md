Watching lots of Worth It. It's great. Good concept, and rapport between the hosts. The food part is great, and seeing cheap and super expensive special food is interesting.

Work didn't happen as I thought. Some good, some odd. I don't know. I'm not going to think too much about it.

I love leaving weekend mornings empty so I can sleep in. I should fight for this always.
