Good day.

Dinner with E and C for C's birthday was good. Lots of carbs. C seemed eager to talk.

I separated out my involuntary and voluntary expenses and it makes me feel better about where the hard line is. I'm spending a lot on optional things.

Warriors are winning, so always a mood booster.

Nothing tomorrow, which is great.

The only snag is Monday when I have to get to the airport in time to pick up dad after work. And the kick off meeting where it's always do-or-die. My next meadow is after I close the garage door and drop dad and V off.

I am so attached to streamers. Feelings bubble up and I feel such a need to form bonds with other people and be part of a community. It's very effective. I want to donate again. I am very easily swayed apparently.
