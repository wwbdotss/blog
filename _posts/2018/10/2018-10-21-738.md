Lunch with S went just like all the other times. I'm left feeling not much. She's pretty and smart and nice. I don't know. There's no connection. We went to a Sichuan place. The duck dish wasn't very good. The noodle dish was. Nothing was very spicy, which I'm proud to say. I sweated, but I didn't get over my head with the spice. We walked to the park and into the botanical gardens. That's a really nice part of the park I'll go back to again for sure. I bought Sphere from the Green Apple, and then we parted ways and she went home. Throughout it all I was trying to figure out who I was and why I spend so much time not being myself. Right now I'm going to treat it as a friendship. I'm happy to go out and keep hanging out with S like this. I think.
