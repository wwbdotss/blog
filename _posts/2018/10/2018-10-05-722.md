The flu shot made me kind of half-sick. Fatigued, slightly sore, sleepy. I took full advantage of naps on the shuttle bus. I'm looking forward to them now, especially around 5 p.m. after work.

I have three computers on right now. It's insane. Civ on the desktop. Twitch on the work MacBook Pro because my MacBook Air can't handle streaming apparently. And I needed to log into my bank accounts on my own laptop. It's hot in here.

Dad will be going on vacation for three weeks on Sunday.

I will sleep in tomorrow so hard.
