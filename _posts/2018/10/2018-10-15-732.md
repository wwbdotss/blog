Unsatisfying day at work. I hate, hate covering for people. Everyone on the original project is go and no one knows what's going on.

I finally redeemed my gift card from June. Bought a hat. It felt good to clear it out of my inbox, even better than getting the gift itself.

I need to get a haircut for tomorrow, cause I will be going to meetings and interact with people, but I actually really don't give a shit, thinking about it. No haircut. I'll just look like crap. I'm not going to do anything or put in extra effort into work. It's going to ruin me probably but oh well.

I have to go down again tomorrow, so shitty. I have to go to bed early, wake up early, ride the bus and wonder if I will pass out, not get any work done, attend meetings I have no idea about, miss lunch, rush to catch the bus back. And throughout all this, worry about Thursday when I have to be there helplessly for the launch when I don't know anything and be forced into the position to assume responsibility. I hate everything about everything.

Watching Until Dawn stream. It's good! Kate's streams have been dull lately and I'm losing interest. I for sure regret tipping so much. I won't tip again ever.
