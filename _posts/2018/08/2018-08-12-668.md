Breakfast with G and R was wholesome. Dumpling Time is good, despite trappings. Went along to the playground and watched them play with their kids. Then to the food truck stop for ice cream. They would go back home for naps.

I walked around waiting for coffee with S at 3. I was so sleepy. I first waited at the appointed place, but it was too full, so I went to look for another coffee place a few blocks away. It was also full. So I walked back again back to the original place and met her there. Walked back to the other cafe, which luckily had emptied out a little and we managed to get a table. That worked out great! It was a nice small cafe too.

The app and website talk was normal, and I didn't offer much new or productive feedback about anything. It felt pretty nice just being with her there and not being alone. We left and got to shabu early to get seats without waiting. Shabu House is just like before, didn't change a bit. It was still good. We talked mostly about nothing, but I felt more at ease about it than before, which was great.

Still sleepy, sleep is going to be good. Thinking about buying more crypto. It will be some action, doesn't matter if it's effective. Or, well, it's more like movement than action, since it's pretty much wild flailing. It excites me.
