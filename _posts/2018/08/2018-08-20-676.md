Love that I took two more days off.

Woke up at 11. I had oatmeal, green tea, and a croissant at the cafe. I spent time listening to music.

I left because I wanted to walk, and I was fucking annoyed by some kids that came in. I could have kicked them, I hate children so much at that moment. I wanted nothing to do with them.

I walked to Stonestown. I got udon, which was pretty good. Smoothie. Then home. Wasting time online. Trying not to ween myself from crypto again.
