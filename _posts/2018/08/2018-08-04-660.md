Stayed up super late last night playing Pillars, until 3 something. Woke up with a headache past noon. Walked down toward the beach. Streamline, salad with ginger dressing with ginger chicken. Walked up the highway listening to Acq Inc. Cut across to my running trail in the park, turned again. Stopped at the library to pee, get some water, read Scientific American, and take a breather. Walked home. Playing Pillars and watching stream now. 5:40 p.m.

I bought a super insulating sleeping bag and excited to see how it handles in the field. I take so much delight in defying nature and circumstances.
