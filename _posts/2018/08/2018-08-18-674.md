Waking up naturally in a tent in the woods is the best. The quality of light is exceptional. So smooth and serene and clear.

Hiked around the lake, which was nice. I pathseeked.

K arrived, which was great. He talked a lot.

I napped, got up to eat, sliced a watermelon with a katana!, napped again. The rhythm of that life is amazing and I aspire to doing that forever.

I just hate being around L. I don't want to talk or interact with him whatsoever. I don't give a fuck about him and could never see him again.

The day went by. I was waiting for night so I could burn more wood. Slept. Another bad night of sleep on the hard ground. The cold was a nonfactor.
