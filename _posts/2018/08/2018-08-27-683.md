I have nothing to do now that I've self-exiled myself from crypto. I have streams and writing. That's it. I will keep that up. I don't know what else to do; I've gotten myself into such a rut, where I think I only have those few options to do in my spare time.

I can read I guess? Or watch movies. Or TV shows. I can do things that involve meeting people. At the very least I should do that, get myself into situations where I interact with people. It's the only way forward.

I don't like work more and more.

I'm setting myself up for disappointment by looking to crypto to save me from my life. Every minute that it hasn't made me rich is a little cut to my spirit. How long can I last before I start checking prices again? I hope I make it at least into September.

I have no idea what I'm going to do about S. I don't know if I actually like her enough to ask her out, or if that's the cowardice talking again. I have all the wrong reasons to do it, but I can't determine if that's actually the case. I've rationalized things so much to myself that I can't see clearly anymore, and don't know what truth looks like, or how I really feel. I have no geniune bone in my body. I'm all front. There's nothing behind there anymore.
