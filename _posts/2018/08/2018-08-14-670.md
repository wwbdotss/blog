Obviously I wouldn't get my paycheck today. Why did I let myself think I would?

I'm just hating on everything. I fucking don't want L to come camping. I don't want to interact with him. I have no idea why E wanted to invite him. He makes me hate myself for hating him. He brings out the worst in me.

I'm ignoring all chat about the camping trip until tomorrow. I need to get over my mood.

I put my head down at work; it was so boring. I have little faith in the company surviving launch season. There are holes everywhere with all the changes and I can't depend on the producers, or some of the developers. I can't really depend on myself either because everything is shifting under our feet and failure is obvious.

I have nothing to now. Stream is cancelled. I haven't had anything to do for a long time. I can't read any more about crypto. That is so pointless. I'm waiting for V to send me payment receipts for dad's DMV double payment and I can't be bothered to ask her for it. Minimal exertion.

What can I do? Write? Watch YouTube. Play video games.

Oh that's right, I still have an onigiri in my bag. That's the best thing that happened today; me remembering I have that.
