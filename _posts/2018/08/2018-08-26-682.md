It was nice spending time with S. Lunch at good ramen place. Crazy Rich Asians. Boba. Then walked around the mall, and looked at hella expensive designer clothes. I was again not being myself. I don't even know what myself means anymore when I interact with people. I don't think I exist outside of myself. I'm not brave enough to be myself. What?

Don't want to go to work tomorrow.

I'm thinking about starting a new story. It'll be a wholesome farmer teen fantasy. All the tropes are there, and I can focus exclusively on evoking feelings and effectively writing, language, and depth. The plot is whatever. I want to *like* writing in the world, and have it be a comfort.
