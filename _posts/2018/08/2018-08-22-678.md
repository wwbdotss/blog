Feel better today. I had a moment of happy clarity on the bus back. This is what I should feel as a baseline. I need medication. I'm banking on meds fixing everything.

I was happy because meeting someone from the other agency wasn't bad at all. He was friendly, which helped a lot. It's such a contrast with the other person, who was dull of face. He might be ok, but that first impression really mattered.

The work isn't as bad as I feared. I still don't know, and bad things would happen no doubt, but the set up seems pretty fine. I have more confidence in the team. The email is short too, so that's a bonus. I feel I have time, and that I could fully dive deep and make it as perfect as I can. It's not a rush job where I inherit code.

I didn't have to sit next to J and talk, even though he was on the bus both times. Luck. Hope it continues to hold. If I have to, I could maybe wait for the bus one stop further to ensure there are no double seats available. There's my deceitful nature again.

Set a time to watch Crazy Rich Asians with S. All good.

ETH is down, which is good and what I wanted while I wait for my deposit to post. Are things going to go my way??

I think my pessimism worked out. Today exceeded my super low expectations, and now I'm happy and pleased.
