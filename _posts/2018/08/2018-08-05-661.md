Feel lousy today. For no real reason, as usual. It's my brain interpreting events in a very negative light that would otherwise not bother me.

Spent all day at home to watch grandma. That automatically starts things off in the negative. Played Pillars all day, and so I felt useless and unproductive. Got my backpack, and I'm having doubts about its practicality. It was so expensive too. I'm not going to return it because it's a hassle. I like how it looks, still, so that's something. I really like its corners. It's bigger than I expected. V was critical of it, in that automatic way, and that annoyed me. That little thing shoved the day over to the bad column for good.

Finished repacking my backpack with stuff and I feel a little bit better.
