Mall day.

The thing I really want to do is eat some gouda and watch YouTube.

Seeing people tomorrow, then back to work.

I can't wait for my next paycheck so I can have real numbers for accounting. I want to buy more crypto so I have a round number for my off-portfolio. That would also get a round number of ETH. I can't depend on the status quo to get me out. I need to make more risky moves for anything to happen.

Fourth uncle came in and I talked with him for a little bit. They're just going to live in government housing in Hong Kong. He won't have a job and just going to spend some time just being with his family. It's interesting.
