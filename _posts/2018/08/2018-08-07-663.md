Went to mom's grave this morning with V. No one else was there except us. It felt way better, going on our own volition instead of following a tradition.

Sleeping bag came in the mail. It's a beefy log. I still need to find my tent.

S texted me about brainstorming ideas for her marketing site. The activity sounds bland; I just want to see her more.
