Normal day. Nothing really at work. Podcasts during commute and lunch. I ate a salsa crepe at the crepeville/house place. Watched Kate stream. Played Pillars of Eternity too long; it's past 1.

I couldn't sleep last night because I was thinking about the apartment at the old house. I fantasized about freedom and living alone again. I need to make this happen.
