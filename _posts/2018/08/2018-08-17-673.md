E picked me up. Got L. It's amazing I've forgotten so much already. I'm trying to remember things sequentially and drawing a lot of blanks and memories from somewhere else. What did I even do and talk about for hours in the car?

Went down Gough to get on the bridge.

Our first stop was Black Bear Diner. Got a scramble with vegetables and fruit, which I liked and felt tidy about. Not too much. Mostly plants and protein.

Then the regional airport. Awkward. TSA agents walking me stand there. Went to the crew house, which wasn't. E woke up a random person. Then UC Merced. Small, clean concrete, in the middle of nowhere. Costco! Highlight. Got slice of pizza.

We got there after sunset. Ate cold steak, which was probably the worst steak I've had ever. I didn't say anything. Whatever.

The sleeping bag worked. I wasn't cold. The ground was hard as fuck though and my body wasn't used to it at all. Joints and bony parts of my body ached all night and it was a pretty terrible night of sleep.
