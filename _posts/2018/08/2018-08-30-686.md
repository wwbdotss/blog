I like watching streams because, like real life, you don't have to pay complete attention to every second of it. I can leave it on in the background and do something else without feeling like I'm missing something. I can't do that with YouTube videos or TV or movies because every second is edited for attention.

Coworker is really annoying me.

Can't wait for this weird week to be over.

I like watching camping videos a lot. The setting up of the site. The tent. Sleeping arrangement. The *fire*. Then the cooking.

I despise having to sleep early so I can get up early for the fucking bus.
