I thought my limit order didn't go through and bemoaned that I had set it just under a local bottom. But then I found out my order got filled early in the morning and I didn't even realize it. It felt great! No fees. I gambled and won. Nice.

Nice weekend time. Time to sleep in.

I really want to buy a new GPU and I'm going to. I like the idea that I could play Pillars of Eternity really smoothly. That in itself is super worth it to me. 1440p is perfect for me now. I don't want 4K yet. My next monitor will be 4K, whenever that becomes more mainstream. Another five years, I'll upgrade again. I'll buy the GPU if I successfully claim the basement.

Fridays are still so good. Watched streams with good interaction. Ate cheese.
