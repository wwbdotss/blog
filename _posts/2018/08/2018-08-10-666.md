After I confirmed that my next paycheck will reflect my raise, the day instantly became better.

Precious Friday nights.

Fourth uncle is here for a couple of weeks. I have no idea how that would coincide with fourth cousin and aunt leaving to go back to Hong Kong. I need to talk more and communicate and ask for information.

We went out for dinner, first aunt, second aunt and uncle, fourth aunt and uncle and cousin, dad, grandma, and me.

I should have talked more with fourth cousin but didn't. He took his medication. I heard that they walked a lot during the day. I think fourth aunt and uncle were careful with him in his condition. He splayed out his hands and asked if they were shaking.

Going to super sleep in tomorrow, so good. Sunday I have to get up early to have dim sum with G and R. It's supposed to be my birthday meal with them and I didn't assert my preference for the time. I hate waking up early and I should have said something. It's not a betrayal of our friendship to move the meeting time, what the fuck. I have all these useless thoughts and justifications for my own passivity.

Then meeting up with S for coffee and hot pot. Brainstorming her app, bleh. The other parts will be good! She just texted me about Outside Lands out of the blue. That's cool! I love it. That is a 100% good thing, no other way around it.
