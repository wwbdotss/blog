Normal day, nothing much to say.

Cashed dad's check. Never felt as resistant to depositing money. Tried out a new salad at Crepeville, quinoa. The cashier recognized me and asked if I wanted the salsa, or the warm chicken, and I should have acknowledged that, but didn't, and rebuffed the show of familiarity and consideration and ordered something else as if they were wrong to assume what I would order. Gross! My constant social failings, and obsessive obsessing after the fact when I couldn't do anything about it and not even trying to remember for next time.
