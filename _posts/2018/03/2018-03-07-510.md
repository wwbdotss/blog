Started watching the new season of Amazing Race and hella cheering for the mixed race couple. It's all because I want to see more Asian men with white women pairs. There are so many the other way around, and I find comfort in seeing counterexamples to that. It's possible for me! I know I get so hung up on these race issues, and I can't help it. Maybe someday I will stop caring and be that model human. But it's me.

Ate some brie with water crackers. Insisted on having some today. It's why I'm going to sleep-deprived tomorrow again.

Had lunch with S at work. Feels good to take the initiative and ask someone to lunch instead for a change.
