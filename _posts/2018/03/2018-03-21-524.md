Ate at Lemonade and it's way too expensive.

I was super excited to watch the VOD because I was going to lose my bit position. Then I found out the point that I lost the position was muted because of song rights. Then I found out that it was actually just past the muted part! Then I found out it wasn't really anything. No one mentioned me. What a roller coaster.
