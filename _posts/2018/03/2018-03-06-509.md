I tweaked the nose things on my glasses, raising them vertically so my eyes actually see through more of the center of the lens, and it's making a difference. I had originally adjusted with the nose things when I first got the glasses, because they were digging into my nose, and I flattened them too much, causing them to slip too far down my nose this entire time. Progress.

Awful sleep-deprived, tired, allergic day. I made bad decisions to get KFC and Quickly popcorn chicken after work. I regret that still. I did it at the time just to do something out of routine. I knew they were bad decisions too. I will get myself into much bigger problems.

Playing Pillars of Eternity has deprived me a lot of sleep this week. I'll sleep early tonight and not play.

I didn't write anything though, which is bad.
