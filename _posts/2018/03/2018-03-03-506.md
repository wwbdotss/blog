Movie with S tomorrow. Once again, I'm so ineffectually grateful that she would invite me out. And what do I do in return? I just lie and say I don't want to meet up with her earlier because I wouldn't be able to wake up early enough. What is that? Why do I insist on lying to everybody?

Once I dropped off the car at the service center, I walked the only sidewalk to the mall. I like malls. But more specifically, food courts. I like cafeterias in general, like the DC. It's a place of choice and low expectations. I feel so comfortable and free roaming around the different stalls looking for something to eat. Driving feels the same. I just hate driving the Lexus cause it's expensive and it's dad's car. There is a lot to lose there.

Looking forward to seeing S tomorrow.
