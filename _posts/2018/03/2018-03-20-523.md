A pretty productive stream/writing night. Outlined what I wanted to do with the flashback chapter. It flows and ties together well. It's a good natural base to build off of, especially the disillusionment part. I need to remember to emphasize this.

I go back and forth on whether I want to buy more bits. Kate is really good at her job. She invokes these emotions and feelings out of her chat to encourage people to sub and tip. It's magic. Charisma I guess. Same thing.

I'm not enjoying work right now. So many unknowns and variables and I don't feel secure. Not feeling that great about new manager. I definitely don't feel the same way about him as I do about my past manager. Trust. And history.

Not eating at home tomorrow for sure.

Still raining lots.

I need to buy more soylent but I've spent so much money this month already. I'm hungry right now and can't drink the caffeine soylent. I need to take like 15 seconds in the morning and just drink them.

I did do my three sets of curls today. So that's something.
