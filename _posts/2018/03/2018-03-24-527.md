Productive day. Got haircut. Got S's birthday present. Two solid to-do item things and I did them.

I'm typing on the desktop on the mechanical keyboard, which feels good. I don't feel as comfortable with the desktop as I do with the laptop now. It's weird. I've gotten used to the closeness and smallness of the laptop. The desktop now feels distant, especially with the big monitor and the hum of the tower. It's too bad. It's why I'm not using the keyboard as often, even though it's so tactilely satisfying. I should really be writing on this. Oh well, it's too bad. I attach the keyboard and mouse to the laptop to try to get around this, but seeing the laptop all tied down with cables hurts my heart.

I also haven't set up github or atom on the desktop and am using the github browser UI to write. It's the worst. Why is the font size so small??

This is what sloth begets.

S lunch tomorrow. I want it over with, then I can concentrate on all my other problems. Buh.
