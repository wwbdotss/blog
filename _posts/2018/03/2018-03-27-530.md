Knew it, I didn't get to present like I was frantically preparing for, including going to work early today. I did manage to wake up early. The alarm was at 7 but I got out of bed at 7:50. So, so hard. Got to work about an hour early, but spent half to three-quarters of that bleeding over an email.

Didn't write today.

I got really wrapped up in figuring out how to loop through cells in two columns. I jumped back on to work on it after I got home.

I forgot my earphones and used the Bose and it was pretty good. No wires is so great. I felt free. I'm going to do just use the headphones from now on for the commute.

Not going to wake up early tomorrow.
