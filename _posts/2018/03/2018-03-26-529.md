Going to try to wake up at 7 tomorrow. The ideal time I aspire to. It feels different because I feel compelled to work harder by throwing just more time at it. I want to dial in the current thing.

Listening to another post-apocalytic podcast. It's slow, but also stuff is happening.

Thinking too much about work. That tab is high right now. Family tab is on auto-pilot.
