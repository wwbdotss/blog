One of the worst days. I have concrete evidence to back up my paranoia and anxiety about work. I have never fitted in on the dev team and have always been the weakest. The one thing I really, really liked about my old manager was that he knew all my weaknesses and ignored them, knowing what my place was. The new manager, as a normal person I suppose, just see the gulf and rightfully try to suss out the situation. I feel like I have to prove myself and it's fucking stressful, especially with goals. Those were just paperwork nuisance before, but now it's a threat to reveal how far I am from everyone else. It fucking sucks, and this insecurity is enough to make me quit. It's exactly why I quit the previous job, cause I felt insecure and threatened that I would expose myself as a fraud, and that I really don't know anything. Fuck. I can't ignore things now.

I tipped Kate the rest of the bits just to feel something else today besides deep, broad despair.
