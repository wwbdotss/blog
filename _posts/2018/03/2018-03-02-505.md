Rain. Walgreens umbrella. Bad greasey pizza for all-hands. Nice chat with A about Annilhilation. Then nice IM with her and telling her about my date at Spices. I'm so nostalgic for my early twenties. Obligatory tea later with other A. It was nice of her, but still pretty forced. I hate compliments. Reinstalled everything on the PC. I feel so detached from it now that I know something could happen and wipe everything out. I don't plan to even have sites remember any of my passwords. I'm just going to use it to play games and watch streams and Youtube.

Just reinstalled Pillars. I wonder if my saved games will come through.

Taking dad's car for oil change tomorrow. I'll probably eat at the diner where Fresh Choice used to be.
