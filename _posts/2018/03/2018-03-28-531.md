I am not as nervous or obsessing about presenting tomorrow, but I can sense the anxiety rising the more I think about it so I'm going to not.

Nice quiet day at work and I concentrated.

Went out for lunch with coworkers. Turkey chili was back. Ate some hot food vegetables.

Ate out for dinner. Wrote/watched stream at Starbucks.
