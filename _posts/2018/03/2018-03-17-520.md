Blue Danube, it was good. Read The Gone World, which I wasn't getting into. Got mixed green salad and small chai latte. The classic combo. Got lychee ice cream crepe with strawberries and whipped cream. Walked to Mountain Lake Park, then bad 28, then Parkside. I gave up on the book and returned it. Home. Played some Civ just to see. Dad asked me why I didn't accept second uncle's offer to set me up with someone. I don't know how to express myself and what I want. That's everything wrong with me pretty much.

I don't like having to have to physically go over to the travel agency to book the New York trip.

I had a spike of thrill and motivation when I thought about organizing and writing my book with HTML and CSS. It's so weird how I want to do that! I really look forward to and want to do that too.
