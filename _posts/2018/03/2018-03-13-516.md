I'm liking Twitch more and more. There's a place for YouTube for crafted videos. Twitch has *engagement*; I can watch streams for hours. It's the kind of engagement that doesn't demand all my attention either. So perfect for shortening attention spans.

I don't think the two orders of bits are going to go through. Nothing has been charged and support has basically given up I think. No response. I'm mostly tempted to buy more to round it off. I don't want to tip 500 then go down to 250. Lame. I'll wait on it.

Rain today. Most of this week.

I can put S's lunch on the dread list I guess, like all social events. In two weeks.

Wrote more today, so that's good. I have about six more scenes to wrap up Part 1. I can feel the end. I'm going to do it. So fucking excited. It's going to happen finally. After this draft, I can start getting picky and overthink and indulge.
