Having the worst time reinstalling Windows. Something is wrong with my hardware. Memory perhaps? That's what started everything. After the last hard crash, Windows 10 didn't show the password prompt and I couldn't log in. Reinstalled Windows 7. Downloading Windows 10. Should have installed the drivers for the new wireless adapter to get that 5 GHz speed. It's 1:19 a.m. now and I'm tired and feeling allergies-like and ate some really salty cheese and crackers. I had already downloaded Windows 10 at first, but didn't activate my newly installed Windows 7 yet. I didn't even realize that was the problem until I stumbled across it on a random forum help post. I need to see this through though, at least to see if it is in fact possible to reinstall Windows 10 from the free upgrade.

Sparsely rainy with wind. It's not the best weather, but it sounds ok.

If I put the PC to sleep tonight, will it wake up again?
