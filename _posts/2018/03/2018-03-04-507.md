Spent the afternoon with S. It was good. Black Panther was a better movie on the second viewing. Everything fits together. I could see the story elements all there. It's good. IMAX 2D was nice quality too. I tried to remember what it was like at Dolby, to compare the two in my mind, but couldn't tell the difference. Maybe if they're side by side somehow. She ran up to me before the movie because she missed her bus, and it feels so good to see someone running up to me. We got boba, then the movie. Then Chipotle. She had gotten some food at a farmer's market so didn't get anything. We talked for a while. I put eating on automatic; I couldn't do both. I am so deceitful. It's shameful and chronic. I need to make a really, really concentrated effort to not lie for convenience. Let the truth slip out by default and not random lies. I know the feeling when I'm about to say random shit and it's right then that I need to step in and nip it in the bud. Fuck. Then we walked through Bloomingdale's to get to the mall. They put soap and chocolate and candy next to each other. We got cream puffs at Beard Papa's. Then home. I successfully asked her to the Color Factory. That worked out.
