Rain is here, but is muggy. I lost my umbrella at Chipotle. I have no idea what I'm doing with so many useless Twitch bits. I still have it justified in my mind, but I'm putting in some work. I should ask for another refund for the last batch I managed to buy successfully. Amazon done fucked up. I would have paid and tipped the full 1000 if they had let my purchase go through. Bits whither if I think about it for more than five seconds.
