S asked me to her birthday lunch. I made an excuse the last time she asked me. I'll go this time!

Lunch with dad today at the diner in the corner. We hardly spend time alone. It was fine. Talked a little about the New York trip.

Ran to Jamba Juice and they didn't have juice.

Ate some borsch, which was good. That sour cream though.

Played a lot of Pillars of Eternity.
