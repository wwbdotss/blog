Handwriting and typing on an actual keyboard helps a lot with journaling. Far more fun and tactile.

WFH. Starbucks. Coffee and croissant. Furious working. Lunch at Lemonade for vegetables. Frantic running around above West Portal looking for a quiet spot for call. So bad. Library. Just watched stream, also frantically, anxiously. I felt bad for not working. The dip of the day was that late afternoon. Walked toward Parkside not sure what I wanted. Got boba. Library again to sit. Read a magazine. Wrote in journal, which felt amazing, been too long. I felt a lot better after that. Duck noodles. Home. Staying up now to watch crazy 500k view stream with Drake playing Fortnite.
