Worked on the follow up email while watching stream. Even though I *know* all this work will go to waste, that the effort I'm putting in will not yield commiserate returns, that something stupid and petty will happen to nullify the worth I assign it, it's still pretty good in the here and now. I've been more aware of that lately, being present and everything, that right now is the only time that matters. The past and future are subject to it and merely perhaps flavor it. The present has and will always be the main attraction.

Anyway, I have a really bad foundation that I'm building the email upon. It's so precarious. Communication is poor and I'm making a lot of assumptions and what they've given me is poorly documented and leaves lots of potential holes. So many things can go wrong, it's ridiculous. I can spend months trying to get them to give me what I need and to make everyone aware of what everyone else is thinking. It's so expensive to try to reach full understanding. It's why I just do it and see what happens rather than try to reach mind meld. So that leaves the project in a super fragile state. Someone sneeze and it's all over.

It's getting hot again. Sucks. Off top blanket.
