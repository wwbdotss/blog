Tipped $500. I was going to tip $1000 but the rest of the payment didn't go through yet. I'm trying to figure out how I feel about this. I felt really good watching the stream, which prompted the impulse tip. Financially, it doesn't feel any different. It's always nice to have more money of course, but I don't know what I would have spent that on to make me feel this way. All about feefees. Since feeling is first!

I am kind of stuck with the rest of the bits sitting in my account. I would end up with $750. Not a good number. I need to either buy $250 more, or go through with cancelling $250. This is adding a weird wrinkle to all this. I can't tip more than $2500 at once, so there goes my fantasy of having $10,000 pop up. PayPal would have to be the way to go.

I feel *something*.
