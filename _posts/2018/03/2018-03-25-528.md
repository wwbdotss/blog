Lunch with S was good. It was only her one friend. I had enough experiences that I could naturally draw them into conversation! I'm normal enough! Iceland and Victoria German movie. Opinions on Mars.

Wine bar. It was as expected. The wine all tasted the same to me. The meat and cheese board was good. Pate. Just two oysters. Forgettable. Pebbley.

Bakery stuff after. I reconfirmed that the k amann thing was just ok. Like a short glazed croissant.

I then walked horrible against the wind and sun up to and across Crissy Field to scout out Planet Granite. I had worn my shorts underneath my jeans, but it was 4 and I wasn't going to pay for only two hours. The bouldering section didn't look that great, but that's expected that when compared to Dogpatch. I'm still going to try it out, maybe next weekend.

I then wasted lots of time taking the wrong bus and taking the right one to double back.

Drove V to Target to buy a lot of glue for her program.
