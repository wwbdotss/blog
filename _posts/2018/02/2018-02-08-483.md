Pixel's great.

I'm spending a lot this month. Over $1400 already. It doesn't bother me. Yet. Half of that is the phone. Another $100 is the Nokia 2 that I'll try to return. Another $100 is for R's birthday dinner. I still have an expense check coming in for the conference. I can justify my spending all day long!
