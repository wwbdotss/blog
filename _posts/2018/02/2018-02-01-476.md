I got R a present and it made my day. I picked out a book and had it gift-wrapped. It makes such a difference! The present itself is not that great, but I really like taking the time to think about it and to go to a store and buy it. There's meaning here and it feels great.

Dinner out today. Got lime wings at Panko. Then boba at Steap, which was actually grass/glass jelly and it was pretty good. Got a cup of bean chili and a bowl of tomato basil.

Watching Kate stream at Starbucks. I'm content.

I finally committed to one approach at work. I had been vacillating and the indecision had risen to my most immediate threat. Small things bother me so much. 

ETH is still above 1000 when I checked yesterday and that's keeping me buoyant. That's higher than my last accounting at the end of the year, and that's a good at-least to have. Can I last for a month before checking again. Probably not.

Tomorrow dinner with R and G. That'll be good.
