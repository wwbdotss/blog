Saw Annihilation. It did in fact stay on my mind afterward and I'm still thinking about it.

The Mel's on Van Ness closed, what the fuck. I was super looking forward to going there and getting a chicken pot pie and a shake today. It's like, why did it fail me just when I need it? It's bullshit.

Ate random stuff at Japantown over three places. It was a clusterfuck of piece meals. I hated everything about it and I should never do that again.
