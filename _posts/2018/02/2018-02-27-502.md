Saw Black Panther. Meh. I like how the trappings are different. It's just another action movie though.

I really want to check crypto. One more day? Or one more month. I try to dissuade myself from checking by imagining a lousy price right now. Lousy or mediocre, same difference. I bet I'll look and it's 600. That'll be hilariously anti-climactic.

I really just want to play Pillars of Eternity.

Outlined some more on the sexy princess character.

Excited to watch the tournament stream tomorrow. Kate getting the chicken dinner last time was the highlight of my whole stream watching experience.
