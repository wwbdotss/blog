New Year's lunch with relatives. Two table's worth. V had work so we left about 45 minutes in and I drove her with dad's car. It felt fine driving after having not for a few months. The meal was pretty bad when I got back; everything was cold and gelatinous. I really couldn't connect with anyone there. I feel ok around my aunts, and mom's brother's wife, but everyone else, I hardly know or know how to talk to, like F and L. Uncles not much at all either. When I walked with dad to the car, it seems the only thing we could really talk about is car stuff. At least it's something I suppose.

Waited at home most of the day for first aunt to come back before I left for a run. I did my home work out and felt pretty good. Ran and listened to Kate's stream. It was windy at first and cold enough that I was glad I wore my blue puffy jacket. I got it soaked with sweat though. Got 711 hot wings on the way back. They were pretty tasty but still gross.

Picked up Pillars of Eternity again. It probably is the most satisfying RPG I'm going to play. It's pretty much what I wanted after Baldur's Gate. It lacks something to make it truly great though. No one expects it to be an exceptional game, and it met those expectations. It's nice and okay and that's fine.

So late. It's 1:30 a.m. I'm going to suffer in the morning.
