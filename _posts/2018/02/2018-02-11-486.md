Gym, success. Had a good morning with grandma too. Made oatmeal. Got her wonton noodles and fried rice. Blogged! Got a close portrait of her I really like.

Still getting used to the glasses. Went to wedding dinner of loosely related relatives. No idea who most of the people were, including the bride and groom. I don't like these dinners at all. I craved water the entire time.

I've been sleeping early and so now, at 9:50, I'm sleepy. I don't know if the glasses, too tight?, or allergies or what, but I still feel residual badness, like I haven't fully recovered from the flu or whatever that was that floored me for a week. Ugh.

I'm close to the end of the gray text on my latest draft. I'm ok with whatever I have locked down so far, things aren't perfect but at least they are intelligible and there's a line you can follow through the plot. Things are happening in the writing part of my life, the part that I cling so desperately to, and that's a really good thing.
