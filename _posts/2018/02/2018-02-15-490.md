Off-day gym. I kept it up! It's working. I need to just do it no matter what and try to not overthink and make excuses or rationalize.

I need a haircut, cut my nails, do taxes, buy new nail cutters from Walgreens so I could cut my nails, schedule doctor and dentist appointments, and so many bits and bobs.

Trying out the Zero Carbo is going to be nice.
