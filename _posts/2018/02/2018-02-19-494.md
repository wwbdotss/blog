New boss lunch was fine. He stuck to polite conversation.

Listening now to fan theories and discussions about Oathbringer. I'm so looking forward to finally diving into all that than reading the book itself.

Feeling not great. Feeling trapped in my life in general. Lure of the crypto. Not setting up the trip for dad. Missing gym day. Earphones not really working out. Spending so much money this month. Not getting the Amazon refund yet, if ever. The end result of all my stressing and hopes I've hung on writing is definitely not going to save me. I don't think it'll even be close. I'll end up with a Google doc. That's it. It still has a lot of meaning though. That would make it worth all these years of struggle. I'll still have all my problems.

The only way out is to help people out; be less fucking selfish and think about others; care about people. AKA: love. I'm pretty loveless. This is the truth. It's hard. It's simple. I need to learn this. It's the only way to happiness and peace and unassailability.
