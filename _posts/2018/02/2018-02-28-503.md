WFH. Spent the time watching the tournament. I was shaking from nerves before, during, and after; it was incredible, vicarious living through Kate. It's super rare for me to feel so involved in entertainment. The last time was probably when the 49ers lost the Super Bowl. I love streams.

Hated hot pot. I feel out of place with my family. I didn't want to interact at all, probably from being so spent from watching five hours of streaming. I didn't want to cook and wait for my food. I didn't want to have to be quick with getting what I want from the pot before other people get it. Things don't taste good just being boiled in water. I don't like being around raw food all over the place. Just the whole thing.

Cousin asked me about crypto and he just told me the current prices. That ruined my price blackout for the month and I just looked everything up and it's mediocre as fuck. Nothing is going to change in a month's time either. Or three month's time. Or half a year. I would need to try again next year if I really want to give it a chance for a pleasant surprise. It's not going to happen and I'm sad. I have no incentive to follow crypto in the short term now. I can't stand reddit. Nothing's happening; just promises and wishful thinking. Ugh. That's one less obsession and thing that I care about. I still have the book.
