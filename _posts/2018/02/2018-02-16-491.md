I really need a haircut. The nail clipper I got from Walgreens is so shitty. Left the dongle at home and couldn't listen to anything all day. Audio-jack-less phones are bullshit. Uneventful day at work. Smooth at least. Tried to find a good explanation of quantum computers and still couldn't understand. The $11 haircut place was closed today, naturally. I was too lazy to go back uphill so stayed on Post to get to the bus. Went to the sushi booth, and felt really accomplished when I took a picture of the booth like I had planned. I liked the picture too.

I feel the urge to check crypto, hearing that bitcoin's back up above 10k. RESIST.

I really want to cancel YMCA and joining the boulder gym. I would actually want to go.
