Dinner with R and G was regular. Kids were stressing me out. How could anyone have so much energy to attend to them 24/7 like that? It requires superhuman powers. Parenting is like the hardest thing in the world.

The place was the fancy expensive kind that I get hungry afterward. Exactly that happened. After Starbucks, I didn't want to get thai again and ate some crackers from Walgreens. Half a chocolate bar. And some artificially sweet water. It's probably the worse meal I've ever had. I was going to eat cereal but instead just ate like the entire bag of Gardettos. I felt so gross.

Watched stream until late. Fell asleep without blogging. Writing this on Saturday.
