Pirated Chris Rock special. It was pretty good.

Worked out at home. I still need to think about if I want to cancel YMCA and join a climbing gym. It sounds so good. I don't know if there's even any discrepancy between theory and reality here. There's no downside. I'm already wasting money not going to the Y!

Listless. Restless. Drifting along. I'm still not going anywhere.

I almost checked crypto but resisted. It feels good now knowing that I didn't give in. There's no real benefit in this self-depravation other than to deprive myself. Maybe a little. I'm no longer checking at work and instead using the attention to other things, which may be just as useless, but at least they're different and something else besides crypto all day every day.

I can't see my new manager lasting long for some reason. I don't think the company has much to offer people to keep them.

I need to get Black Panther tickets. I need some injection of current popular culture. I need some hook onto what people are experiencing so I don't feel so damned lonely and detached from everybody.

Just bought ticket.
