The new pho place I liked was on vacation and I had been looking forward to it. It was that kind of day. Things not going my way. Subway troubles with uncertain promises of shuttle buses got me off the bus and out on Forest Hill, super stranded. That hilly middle area of the city is such a dip and trap. There's no directness there; everything winds. Technology failed me miserably. I couldn't find an alternate route because Google doesn't know the trains are all fucked up and only shows the top routes, which are all trains from the subway when I need surface buses. I had two Lyft drivers cancel. The third one came just as I need to dial in to stand-up and I hated having my attention torn in two like that. Worst commute.

Bought unnecessary and bad salad, thinking the bulgoi kimbap wouldn't suffice. It's the exact excessive, unnecessary feeling when I bought the Japanese earphones and the earphones with the volume control just at first. I'm spending so much money this month. It's stupid. Nokia phones. $15 meals all over the place, being the standard now for lunch. Not getting reimbursement checks soon enough. Not doing taxes yet. Slob.

Just read more about the new tax bill after seeing a higher paycheck. Interesting. Started reading the tax bill itself. Then stopped.
