Allergies kicked into high gear. I used up like a whole box of tissues at work. Got some Wali-tin.

Ate a super good meal at the tiny sushi booth. Mini chef's choice. They wrapped the whole thing in a square of cloth. It was the best. Several pieces of assorted sashimi and roe with a bed of kale and dressing under the fish. That setup was perfect. I wouldn't have eaten the salad if it were not for the dressing. I could see people using the dressing if it were not hidden under the sashimi. Perfection of presentation. Bowl of rice. Miso soup. And a pack of roasted seaweed sheets. So good. I'm going to go there much more often. I felt so alive eating it. It's what eating should feel like all the time.

Watched lots of youtube. Ate the rest of the beef jerky. I ate some cereal too. I ate a lot during dinner too. It's probably because of my day at the gym on Sunday.

My left testicle feels funny. I feel a weird pressure in the groin. I probably have testicular cancer and will die.

So sleepy. The allergy or whatever the fuck this is, another round of the flu because of my luck, makes me feel sick. The phelgm is triggering my gag reflex too, and bringing on the slight nausea. This is the worst.
