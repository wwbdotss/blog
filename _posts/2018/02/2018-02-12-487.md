Super normal day. I think L is going to quit. I'm so sad. I'm tired of getting to know coworkers and then them leaving. I'm pretty sentimental.

I'm through with the chapter 7 gray text and it feels so good seeing a blank expanse after that. I'll fill it with more gray text, but this is a definite sign of progress. the end is in sight. Almost halfway there. The thing only has 15 chapters.

All this is possible because of Kate's stream. It's a really disconnected chain of causes, but it comes down to her stream, at the end, that got me into a rhythm to work on the book consistently. It's convoluted, but whatever. I still fantasize so much about donating 10k to her. I watched hours of reaction videos from streamers getting huge donations. It's so compelling. I want to see what happens when I do it. I think it's a really funny way to spend my profits from magic internet money on magic internet TV. It's appropriate.

I can totally make it to the end of March without checking crypto prices. This is easy.
