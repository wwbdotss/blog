Walked along the beach up, followed some part of the running route. Boba, then bus to the mall to finally get some pizza. It wasn't as good as before, and I couldn't tell why. Too much cheese? Walked back for Kate stream. Won something in her giveaway!

Earbuds came. They all sound the same. I can't tell the difference, unfortunately. $3 ones sound the $200 ones I got a while ago. The rubber tips make the most difference between sound quality than any other part of the earphone. It's why I really want a custom one molded to my ear.

That'll go on my list of things to buy when I have $10 million dollars--and no less. Custom earphones. Donate $10k to stream. Tesla. House. 4K HDR OLED TV. Ultrawide monitor. What else do I want.

Dim sum tomorrow.

Finished taxes.
