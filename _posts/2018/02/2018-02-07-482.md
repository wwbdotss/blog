I feel so good! Wal-itin is so good!

I still have phelgm and snot, but I haven't felt so normal and clear in a while. I don't really know why I feel so great. Today wasn't that much different from yesterday. Work was fine. Family is fine. No crises. I don't know. Random flair of dopamine and serotonin? I'll take it!

I had to change Coinbase auth keys and accidently looked at crypto prices. It's still more than the last time I bought so that's all I need.

Gave up on the Nokia. Slow as fuck and didn't charge for no reason. I ordered a Pixel.
