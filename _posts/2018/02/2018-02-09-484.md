Sleepy, went to bed.

Spent a little time talking with H at the end of the day. She offered me a can of sparkling alcoholic water and it was pretty good. Not sweet, has slight flavor, carbonated, not really detectable alcohol taste, nicely refreshing. It was 5% still and I felt buzzy without finishing the can. Again, it was always so nice to be around her. She totally made that possible. She invited me, and got all the refreshments, she got people involved in the conversation. She's the best! I don't know how to repay her kindness, much less being able to execute on it.
