I really want to check crypto prices now. I can't hold out much longer!

I spent most of the night trying to figure out a name for a temple. I think so hard about names.

Ate at Naan N Curry. Thought the ocra curry would have sauce in it. It totally didn't. The naan was too thick and not that great. I did not enjoy my meal.
