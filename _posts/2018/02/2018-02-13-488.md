Feeling restless at the moment. Antsy. I think it's cause Grandma disrupted my bathroom routine. I also don't know why she's wandering around the house at night.

Work wasn't exactly as I would have liked. The conference was piecemeal and lacked substance for me again. It also reminded me, like all social settings, how insufficient I am at interacting with human beings. That's at the very core of my bad feelings today.

I left early and wandered around, trying to find a place. I ended up at the Chinatown library and pretended to work from there. I read some more Murakami and didn't like him as much as I did before. It's mostly because he likes and makes Western culture references. Beatles and Fitzgerald and white people like that. I want to learn more about Japanese culture, not more of the mainstream crap.

I need to clear away the current project at work and just tie those off. They are starting to aggravate.
