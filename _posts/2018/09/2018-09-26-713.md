Something is biting my ankles. I haven't figured out where the bites are coming from. Fleas? Under my desk. Under my work desk. On Muni? Some park?

I read a post by a Chinese person who's handling all my problems so well. He's going to care for his aging immigrant parents but doesn't care what they think about his life. He doesn't let stereotypes affect how he dates and his decisions on marriage and kids. It provides a very clean, stark, injection of reality to settle my far-ranging imagination and shines a ray of light through my stifling mental head space. Most of my problems are self-created and I'm my worst enemy, fighting projections and phantoms and assumptions. That is a fact. That's one solid foundational thing I can operate on.

I made an appointment to check out my moles! Finally. Reading it in a Reddit post spurred me to just do it. It feels good to finally do it.

I just have to get around to getting medical help with my depression, that'll be good.
