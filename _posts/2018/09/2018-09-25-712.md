Dinner with dad, first aunt, and grandma at King Wah. It was good. Clam and diakon pepper soup.

I bought tickets to This Will Destroy You, invited E and S. Felt so good.

Got a work invite for a meeting about "additional responsibilities." My mind of course automatically veered hard into, am I getting promoted? I no doubt will accept for the money. I want more money. I like being wanted.
