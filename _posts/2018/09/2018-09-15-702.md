Nothing weekend day. What did I even do. I walked a little so I could say I exercised. What did I even eat? My life is so still and boring my brain doesn't even bother registering and remembering anything any more. It's all the same.

Oh that's right. I went down to the plaza to buy pepper spray for V. Then I ate at the sushi place. Green tea. Miso soup. Kami roll, which had the worst pale coloring. Zaru soba.

Then I walked. Library to read some of A Wild Sheep Chase. I felt the itch to go back home and play video games and watch streams and I did until 3 a.m. Ate queso and chips. Also a few blueberries to not feel like complete trash about it.
