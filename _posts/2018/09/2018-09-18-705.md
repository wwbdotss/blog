Same thing happened today as yesterday. Though I feel better about it, for no reason. Work was slightly better maybe.

I wanted to add something to today's record, but I don't remember what it was. My memory is frighteningly bad now. I can't remember what happened a day ago.

I think it was something good. Something I want to write down and remember. It was the reason why I felt happier yesterday than the day before. Did it have something to do with people?

I think it might just be that I love watching moving and apartment furnishing videos on YouTube. It's probably something else, but this is noteworthy because it's a good solid thing that brings me joy.

There must be more to it than that lame ass thing.

Now I remember. It was Joe Rubin and Jimmy Song arguing on the Unconfirmed podcast. It was hilarious. Jimmy was concerned Joe would go to jail and not be able to pay up. Hilarious.
