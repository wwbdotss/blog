Nothing happened today. I did walk hella far in the blasted desert wasteland that is Sunnyvale pavement at noon to try a lunch place I haven't tried before. It was OK and too expensive. Never going back there again.

Listened/watched Kate stream for like 6 hours. It wasn't even that great. It's bad.

I'm going back to the SF office tomorrow. Fuck Sunnyvale. Every minute I spend away from that place is a minute in paradise. I'm exaggerating but whatever.
