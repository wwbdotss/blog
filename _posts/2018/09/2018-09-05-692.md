Played more Civ. It's so good. Mods are the best.

Getting bug bites. I found out it was from my hour in the park near work. I'm so mad. I want to invent little laser beacons that autonomously spot mosquitos and shoot them down.

I'm sleep-deprived, all because of Civ, and I don't care. I can't wait for the weekend so I can just play some more without worrying about waking up for the stupid bus.
