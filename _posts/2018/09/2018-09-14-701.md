S texted me a picture of the sunset! Best thing to happen all week. I can't imagine her thinking about me. What does it mean? Nothing. Maybe more than nothing? Objectively. But what I can do with this information? Ask her out? That's not enough to go on. Is it? Fuck.

Bought a new power supply. I really think the old one, after six years, is kaput. Still a guess though. It would refuse to boot. Then when I unplug everything and open up the case, fiddle around inside not really doing anything, and it would boot up fine again. I realized I wasn't threading the cables through the provided cable management holes in the case and that all that was standardized already. That'll be cool to do with the new PSU.

No more Civ. I reached a point today after I reloaded too many times. That's enough for now and I'm good for several more months.
