No mention of a raise for more responsibility. I'm going to go back to them with that. And ask about how J would be affected if I took the lead role.

Accounting, bleh. Crypto is hella low. I'm not checking again for another three months. Screw this. My normal accounts are rising steadily, which is nice. The universe follows storybook morals apparently.

Not looking forward to tomorrow because I have to get up early.
