Lunch with C and E was good. Kalbi is the best. C and E walked with me to the UPS store. I needed to see how fast I can send immigration papers for First Aunt. Glad I brought it up because C mentioned Fedex, which I wouldn't have thought of. E drove me to Lakeshore, which was also fortunate because Fedex needed it by 4 p.m. Everything worked out. Walked around with E in Big 5.

Fedex can't send any personal letters to China, what the fucking fuck?

I wouldn't be surprised if, after all that, the letter never makes it. It'll get lost. I'll get blamed. This is how it'll happen. I have no control but have to take on the responsibility.

Rewatched the 2014 World Series Game 7. Nice.

Sleep in. Then wander around tomorrow. Good good free day sandwiched in between free days.
