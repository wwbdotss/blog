Walked from E's apartment back home. It was such a nice, new, intentional, active trip.

E's apartment to feed the cats. Tanforan for lemon green tea with aloe and no sugar, Chipotle with steak. It was there in the food court that I decided to walk all the way back. Over 3 hours. I wasn't going to do anything with the time anyway. Starbucks for a breather, got my standard small decaf Americano with milk and two sweeteners. Kept walking. Stopped next at Subway. The poster for the cheese steak was really effective. Got a six inch. Kept walking. Stonestown for Jamba smoothie. Home.
