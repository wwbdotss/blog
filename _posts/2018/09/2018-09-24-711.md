Booked train trip and hotel; I didn't even get PTO approval yet. I can cancel both, so not that edgy, but I'm sick of caution. Go go go!

I didn't go to the work baseball game. Whatever. My loss. I wanted to be home for the moon festival.

My depression is rational. I think. It makes sense to me. The force and pervasiveness of it though, that's surprising. I lost my freedom and my mom at the same time; stretched over two years of continuous agony and stress and helplessness. I think that really fucked me up. And the living at home part is still ongoing and builds up my resentment and guilt at the same time at being resentful.

I should do and not stop self imposing. Self destruction. I sabotage and get in my own way so often.

I also bought audio jack dongles again, the fuckers, and Killing Commendatore for the train trip.
