I'm tired. Work is getting out of hand. I'm throwing up my arms. There is nothing there to care about.

I moved my skin cancer check appointment to after my train trip just in case I do have cancer and it won't ruin my trip.

Checking crypto and doing accounting tomorrow. Hells yes.

Also finding out what the meeting with my boss is about. More money plz.

I dived deep into the prologue last night. That is the kind of writing I want to do forever. I was in there and making decisions and executing and it tapped into my obsessive perfectionist tinkering impulses. It's the kind of self-sustaining, internally driven action I need.

I bought A a succulent. Thinking about how to present it to her is annoying. I'm just going to give it to her and not think about it.

I won't be able to do anything at work tomorrow. It's a mess of a Friday.
