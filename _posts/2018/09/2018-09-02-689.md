Where do I want to live?

I thought I wanted to live in the first house's basement, but the easiest thing would just be for me to live in the second house's basement next to V. That's so simple. The only thing I want is my own space and fridge and door. Everything else stays the same.

That's my first option.

My second option is just for me to move to the first house's basement. Everything else stays the same.

Every other option is much more complicated. I don't even want to think about the permutations.

Played Civ all day.
