Looking into booking a train to Denver. It's so simple. Get PTO. Buy the train tickets. Book a hotel. That's it. One week of bliss.

I will be more specific with my posts. Those are the ones I like to read back on later and the most beneficial and interesting.

Talked to S at work about his train trip for context. He said he didn't like it, because it took 8 hours longer than scheduled. Everything else was fine. Since I have no schedule, that's good to me. The ride wasn't bumpy and not that bad. I texted D about it too and confirmed I should get a sleeper car.

Got a salad a soup from Whole Foods and walked away feeling ripped off, like most of the time I go there. I should not go there.

First aunt made snails but they were still too sandy and inedible. That was too bad. I made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich just at first. Civ and streams. Getting some YouTube in before bed. I should sleep more. I could just be late for work. It doesn't matter.
