Bad Sunday as usual. It's when I really dwell on things I hate about my life, and lose perspective.

Watched documentary about a long plane ride, and the logistics thereof.

Hate having to go down to south tomorrow without no obvious reason for it. I would end up with less time to work, and what time I have would be scattered and distracted. High chance of disaster or pointlessness.

I hate the position and direction my work is going, my life is going. Maybe even the acceleration. Things are going bad to worse, *fast*.

I'm not going to look at crypto for three months, until the next accounting. I'm tempted to not look at it for another year. Two years. This shit is depressing.
