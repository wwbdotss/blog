Walked down to the 18, to the market. I bought some water with strawberries in it out of curiosity. I thought it would be something more, but it tasted exactly what it seemed like it would: weak diluted fruit water. I also got a medium jambalaya, jalapeno roll, creole potato salad, and a bag of root beer marshmallows, which I only ate two of and threw the rest away. It also tasted like what it seemed like.

Walked up toward the Lands End trail, but crossed the street to the Sutro grounds. Found a good picnic table. Ate. Listened to Kate stream.

I then walked back through the park, took a breather at the library, then home.

Good thing First Aunt was home to cook. V came back from Seattle. Played Civ and watched Guy stream.

I will watch YouTube now, no more Civ. I've reached the saturation point.

Not concerned about work tomorrow. I fully expect to do nothing while we're in this nice period right before the announcements. I just hope I don't faint on the bus.
