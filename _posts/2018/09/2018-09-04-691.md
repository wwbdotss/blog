I discovered a reseed mod for Civ and I can just click generate all day long. This is the best.

I'm going to write short stories. I imagined how I would want to introduce myself and when asked what I do, I would say, "I write short stories." It's that simple.

I got all fainty and nauseous on the shuttle, as I feared I would some day. I think it's a combination of lack of sleep, didn't eat breakfast, and the jolting traffic. Or cancer.
