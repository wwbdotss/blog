Stayed up late. It's 1. I'm going to hate myself tomorrow morning. I keep doing this to myself. Played more Civ and it was good.

Dumpling for lunch with dad, grandma, first aunt, and V. Then I watched Mission Impossible Fallout. It had action. I paid $30 for ticket and popcorn. What the fuck. Then I spent $15 on a salad at Mixt Greens that wasn't even good. I need to stop spending.
