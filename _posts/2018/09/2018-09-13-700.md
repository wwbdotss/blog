So I did go down to Sunnyvale for no reason. At least tomorrow will be crystal clear that I can be in the SF office. I will not do anything.

Watched stream, played Civ. I'm doing nothing.

Though it was nice to have lunch with T and then show him my site. He is probably the only person who went through my pictures.
