Civ.

I was the only one in the office for the past two days.

I sat on the park bench at night again with my hood up, phone out, waiting to go home after dinner time. It's the worst.

Tomorrow? The *exact* same thing is going to happen. I guarantee it.

It was nice to watch Space X announcement about the first moon tourist though. That's something.
