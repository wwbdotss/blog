I stare at the picture of the mountain pass highway stop I took, with the falling snow flakes, and I get insanely nostalgic. That was a time before mom died. Before my friends drifted away, before I gave up my apartment. It was the good times of youth I lust after now, and absolutely didn't know how great I had it then, like how I don't appreciate how much I have now. It's always a set up for future regret, and never present gratitude. That's where happiness is and always has been--present gratitude, being thankful for what I have now. I just can't get there. My entire present and immediate and now is full of brimming despair.

I haven't watched a stream lately. Or checked crypto prices. Or gone on reddit. But didn't write either. I can write. I should write.

It's not a quality judgement. It's because I don't want to keep doing the same things. I feel trapped by the routine, and I'm afraid it's all I'm becoming. I want to reserve the right and freedom, and *choose* to stop and do something else at the drop of a hat. It's important to convince myself I have control.

Going away happy hour for M. My heart aches for how good some people are and how sucky I am in comparison. I still have a crush on H and she's so kind and considerate and I don't know how to act around her. I don't know how to reciprocate to show her I appreciate her goodness and for being a wonderful human being. I'm in a constant state of being at a loss.

Listen Your Hand in Mine.
