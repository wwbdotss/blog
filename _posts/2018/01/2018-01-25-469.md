Not sick anymore. Woke up feeling normal. WFH.

Read The Breach. I like thrillers in that they are easy to get into. The style is very clear and straightforward. Not like the morass of Oathbringer. I've gone through hundreds of pages and it's exactly like the first two books in that I don't know what happened and I don't care about anything that's happening because it's all set up for something that's supposed to be great but I intensely doubt will be worth all this.

After I finished The Breach, I felt super sad. The author's obviously single, and since I'm all hung up about that, I imposed my own sorry feelings for myself and realized that even if I write a book, my dream, I would still just be that guy. It's depressing as all hell.

Without being sick as an excuse from life, which I have to face fully again, I'm reminded how empty and sad it is. Or I believe it is. No prospects for anything. Nothing in motion. Just me sitting here feeling sorry for myself. Without a mother.

It's hitting me harder than ever.
