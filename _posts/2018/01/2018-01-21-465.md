V got me cuties, vitamin water, and skyr. I'm so grateful. First aunt and dad too, for taking care of me. It's still lingering, so that means I have cancer and I'm going to die.

I watched streams and read and drank vitamin water. I had spots of clarity and felt normal and then I'd fall back into the trenches and shake from the chills or put my head down from the nausea. I wouldn't hate being sick so much if I didn't have to be dizzy. Everything else I could handle. Being cold, be achy, runny nose, whatever. Just don't mess with my head.

I super don't want to go to work tomorrow. I know exactly how I would feel when I wake up. It's going to be so bad.

One of the impossible tasks that I know for sure would improve my life is for me to wake up an hour early. Just get up at 7:30 and brush my teeth. This would fix so many of my problems, especially the outlook for the day if I don't feel defeated and fatalistic as soon as I open my eyes. Breakfast. Time to settle back from the shock of worldly re-engagement.

That *shall* be my goal.

I haven't checked crypto for a few days, and I'll make it another goal not to for a long time. I'm pretty sick of its hold on me and the sheer logically unnecessity of it.
