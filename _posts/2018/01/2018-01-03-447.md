The sore on my tongue is my biggest immediate problem right now. I'm to be so lucky.

$1000 ETH won't make me happy. Only $10,000 will. And even then...

It was a bad, nihilistic day in the middle of a long string of bad, nihilistic days. What can get me out of this funk? Depression drugs, probably.

The best, pure thing happened though. I texted S that the Amazing Race season premiere was today, and she texted back thanks. This human interaction was free of anything bad; it was all good. Love it.
