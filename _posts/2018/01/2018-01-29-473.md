New, slow ass phone. I'll never find the perfect one.

Still haven't done any work. How long can this last.

Chili naan is pretty good.

Eating deviled egg potato salad. Drinking Safeway kombucha. Kate VOD.

I felt so great buying cereal after work. Dinner was mediocre again. I just don't like first aunt's cooking, sad to say.
