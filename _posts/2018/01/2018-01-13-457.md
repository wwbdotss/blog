I'm the richest I've ever been. Barely and temporarily. This is the peak.

Walked down to Streamline. Got a side salad and bean soup, should get the full salad next time, and their bunch stuff too. This is now my favorite cafe. Close, wifi, with a nice menu.

Took the 18 to Lands End. It's been a while. So many people.

Told G and R that my mom died. I communicated it badly. Looking around at all the happy people in groups around me threw in sharp relief how lonely and disconnected I am. So I reached out and shared. It roused up the everpresent sadness about mom and it felt horrible.

Gave V the Jelly phone. I can't stand to look at the low-res chunky screen. It's scoring very high on the novelty scale though. It would be so different walking around with it. It's an outright anachronism and serves up a lot of cognitive dissonance when I see modern Android on 90s cellphone hardware design.
