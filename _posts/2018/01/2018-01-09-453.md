Ditched work. Sat in a cafe and wrote. Mostly watched stream and crypto, but still.

It didn't occur to me that I could make the to-do app with Javascript and have something working on the web before trying to make an actual app on the phone. Learning Android is a big hurdle I placed in front of myself. This would help, I think.

I put down boxes for the next few days and it helped like it always had. It's magical. It's a control thing. Seeing my time laid out and cordoned off in boxes makes me feel in control and seeing the space and materials I have to work with. It ties in with knolling too. It's all connected.
