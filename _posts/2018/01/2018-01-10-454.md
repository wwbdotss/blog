Totally forgot to write something for today. Doing this now the next day at Starbucks.

The stand-out thing that happened was that I started a new game of Heroes and played the fuck out of it. I got tired of Kate's stream and needed to turn it off. My obsession might be cresting or already have. I fantasized about tipping her $10k and couldn't sleep, thinking about the reaction I would get. It's completely crazy. That urge comes from the dark oily recesses of the lizard and monkey. It's something like buying a sports car, but much more shameful and socially unacceptable. I have no respect at all toward people who tip large amounts on stream. They are in a rarified class of exquisite losers. Small tips are normal and fun. Whatever compels them to tip thousands of dollars is dark. I can't think of a wholesome reason to explain why they do it or what they expect to get out of it. I can't believe I only really see the distinction now.
