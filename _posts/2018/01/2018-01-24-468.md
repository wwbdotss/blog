Woke up feeling pretty good. After lunch felt tired and slept and felt bad. Sleep really messes with me. It may be the real enemy. I haven't been able to properly sleep for a while now. I don't remember the last time I woke up naturally feeling refreshed. Instead, I just either wake up to an alarm and feel sleep-deprived, snoozing doesn't even feel very good anymore, or the worst, I oversleep during the weekends and wake up groggy and dizzy. I never fall asleep when I go to bed early. I just lie there helpless. Yeah, fuck sleep, though it's just an extension of the physical body, and that an extension of biology. Fuck that, ultimately.

It's after dinner and I feel tired and slightly dizzy again. I don't want to repeat what I've been doing the past few days. I can't stand the taste of my own saliva. I can't stand the sound of grandma's voice right now.

Anger is my primary emotion right now. Anger at my circumstances. I need to get that anti-depressant asap.
