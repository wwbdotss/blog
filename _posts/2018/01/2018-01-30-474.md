Feeling ok. I think it's because nothing immediate is going wrong. I'm doing marginal work on the book. New phone to distract me. Finding enjoyment in Kate's stream again after a while of not really. I recovered from being sick for a week and feeling grateful that my body is not actively suffering. V has recovered. Good performance review at work so I have something concrete to hang on to and not let my self-doubt get too much of a purchase when there's reality right there refuting it. Ate at new Vietnamese place in the TL. It was small and ok. Bun bo hue was good. SJ's is better, but still good. I've given myself permission to just buy and eat whatever I want. I have cereal!

Willfully trying hard to ignore bad things in my life is working too.
