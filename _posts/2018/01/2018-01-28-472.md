Walked my favorite route down, then up to the library. Read magazines. Got a single scoop of strawberry lemon. There's something about that area that calms me without annoying me with domesticity. It's special.

Bought Nokia 2 and some Vietnamese beef jerky. I have no idea when the jerky will get here; the site I ordered it from was pretty small.

Watching Kate stream again. It's the regulars in squads, which is the biggest reason why I watch, and it's so cozy.
