Got really sick. Passed out on the bus. That's the second time I've fainted in public. I knew the screaming fuzzy feeling just before I faint really well. I've gotten that a couple of times on the bus and managed to overcome it somehow. The one time, I got off as soon as I could, sat down, and put my head between my knees. That solved it. The second time, I think I just hung on desperately and it went away on its own without me falling off the edge. It is the worst feeling I've ever experienced. A helplessness and crescending nausea and there's nothing I could immediately do. I would take off my glasses next time. They've taken a beating from me falling on them.

The most horrible thing is the hiccups. I have never hated an involuntary bodily function so much. Goddamn.
