I still feel pretty good about not checking crypto. I'll see how long this lasts. I feel dang good about the year-end accounting. I am in no hurry to ruin that. It would be amazing if I can last for three months until the next accounting. What magic things can I expect to see.

Dim sum, pretty good. Streams and Heroes rest of the day. Working more on the book. I feel productive.
