V is sick, ugh. Same flu-ish symptoms. Got bread for her today, so that felt purposeful. I'm not 100% yet myself. I can feel the edge is there, and I'm not close enough to fall over, but it's there. Finally got the salad at Blue Danube. Most meaningful and good thing I've eaten for a while. I eat unsatisfactorily.

Still haven't written. Read some more. The first part of The Ritual is good and I liked it a lot, bought it in a hurry so I could keep on reading past the preview. Then I started skimming; way too much description with nothing happening. Then the second half got stupid and I didn't care at all what was going on. I was there for the Blair Witch creepy woods, not stupid cultish crazy people. It's the difference between unknowable horror and silly gooses.

I put the soylent in the fridge and I'm happy. Keeping the soylent in my room was a holdover from before, when I refuse to settle in and accept that I'm living at home for the forseeable future. It's exactly the kind of self-punishment I did that one time at Post Street when I refused to pull over the blanket and I was just cold for a while, for no reason, refusing to do it, channeling some kind of meaningless defiance against nothing.

Be grateful and help people?

My gut says now is a good time to buy bonds.
