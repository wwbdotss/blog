There is this annoying pimple, sore, thing on my tongue. It's affecting how I eat and sleep. The worst.

I managed to not look at crypto for two whole days, and looked, and ETH had another ATH. That is all I ever ask of crypto, to give me that feeling. It counteracted the despair from hearing my boss is quitting. Feelings are hella fickle and meaningless in that way. They are truly not based on anything solid or objective and can change on a whim, voluntarily, even, if you can convince yourself well. I knew before I checked crypto prices that they would either be down and that was fine because I was feeling shitty already, or they would be up, and would make me feel better. I lucked out. That decision to give in and check price turned my day completely around. I had another awesome surge of joy and happiness and good feeling as I walked home. I listened to that song that goes "a hit of your love" as I sauntered through downtown lights and it was fucking glorious.

I read over my continuity draft so far and it's pretty good! I kept wanting to read more of the story, which is an encouraging sign. It's going to be a lot of work going through all those words again, no doubt, but it's looking worthwhile.
