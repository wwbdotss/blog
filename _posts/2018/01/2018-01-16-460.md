Got four cavities, wtf. Now my health is deteriorating like the rest of my life. I think I know why? It's all the soylent I keep drinking. Maybe. The whole thing is stupid.

I'm at my most blas√© and unmotivated. There is nothing reaching for me, nothing for me to reach toward, nothing beyond the dirt  I'm plodding along on. I feel this way. I don't know what I'm waiting for, even. Crypto to make me rich, right. I'll show them all then. I'm so fucked.

If I go to sleep now, I'll wake up at 4 a.m. or something and drift and feel as if I had fallen asleep at 4, the hours of sleep beforehand would mean nothing.

Working on a new money spreadsheet gives me momentary meaning.
