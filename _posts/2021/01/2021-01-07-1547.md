Read news nonstop. It's weird how disgusted I was yesterday and wanted nothing to do with the news, and today I couldn't get enough. It's the same reason why I like reading sports recaps instead of watching the actual game. I can't stand the suspense. It was very satisfying today to read about the fallout. I was nothing but super scared and disturbed while the Capitol was getting besieged.

Didn't do any work, first day back.

I had the biggest eye-bugging out surprise waking up to crypto this morning. My small portfolio was usually hovering around X, and it was up 20% when I refreshed the charts. Holy shit. This is the beginning of the end though. The drop is imminent.

This is a truth. I am vindictive, and it feels so good seeing people get their comeuppance. Justice boner, so to speak.
