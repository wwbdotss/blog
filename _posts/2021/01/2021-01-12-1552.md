Now I think I have covid. Just the beginning trills in the lung.

Watched Miyazaki documentary. He looked stressed all the time. I think it would be stressful working for him. Crypto down, so I feel bad. I'll try to not check prices until my alert goes off, which could be never. That's an interesting thing to think about.

I'm happier today because dad's symptoms seem to be ok and he didn't want to go get tested so I don't have to deal with that. He probably still has covid though. And also, he and V dealt with the house transfer, so I also don't have to think about that anymore.
