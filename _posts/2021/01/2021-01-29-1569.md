Fnished The Three-Body Problem. It's better at the end for sure, when he went hard into speculation of how the aliens on the other side of first contact will behave, rationally. That was fun.

Watched some Amazing Race on CBS streaming. There is nothing else there I want to watch or stay for. I have a week for the trial.
