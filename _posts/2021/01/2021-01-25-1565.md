Way too stressed out and anxious about any event. It's become bad. Couldn't get to sleep last night from the anxiety of the super simple chore of going with dad to get vaccinated. It was such an objectively low risk, super straightforward task, and it ruined my sleep and I spent days worry about it. What is going on with me mentally? I'm degrading fast.

I'm also irritated easily, and emotional and have abrupt mood swings. I'm also fall into depression frequently. I wake up feeling anxious and depressed, and then I feel that way most of the day, when there's something happening, when there's nothing happening, then sometimes I can't sleep because of anxiety and depression. I used to have these really optimistic and surges of hope when I'm in bed, to such a degree that I can't sleep from that, I'm so excited for the future, and to *live*. I knew that euphoria fades in the morning, but I still had those good feelings, and I enjoyed them while they lasted. That hasn't happened in a long, long time now. I just feel bad all the time.

There was a pretty blonde health care worker at the vaccine clinic.

I ordered a $25 salad. It wasn't very good either.

I don't know how I'm going to fill out my timesheet this week, as there's no work I can see in my schedule.

I should read and finish The Three-Body Problem. I still don't know what it's about yet, and I'm halfway. Aliens I think.

Crypto is down; that's why I feel bad.
