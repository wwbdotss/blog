The past week's so spotty and tattered in my memory. I've spent most of it fixated on the news and sucking up as many articles and as much reddit as possible through my eyeballs. Crypto is hella up. I'm still very far from my sell number though, so I'm caught in this weird middle ground where miraculous gains are happening but they are not good enough.

Walked. I got so irritated with seeing people around and having to cross the street to avoid being too close. I should walk on the beach again. That had plenty of space.

Haven't written anything for days now. So much for that.
