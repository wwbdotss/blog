I need to scrub this blog so people don't follow me home. I've set an alert for $1400 ETH, and will not check crypto until that goes off. I might never check crypto ever again. That would be kind of funny. I feel like this will work, and I can cure myself of crypto addiction. I know that if I do check before the alert, prices would still be low and I will immediately meet with disappointment. Contrast this with if I didn't set the alert, I could just justify that maybe I would encounter a high price and that mystery and potential reward would tempt me. Even though by setting the alarm, I get a daily reminder every day that it doesn't ring that I'm not rich yet, I at least can save myself time. I do miss waking up every day thinking that I would be rich. I really enjoyed those big pumps. I will definitely go back once ETH passes ATH. Until then, it's all disappointment and it's probably below $1000 now. Three more years I guess.

I still do get a little rush though. Every morning before I look at my phone, there's the possibility that I would see my alert notification. That's still there. And the alert could also happen any time, so that's still pretty hype. It would be so cool when it does go off. Hype to the max. Also, I don't have to waste time on reddit. Nothing matters but the price.
