I'm pretty sure dad has covid. Finding a testing site is a pain.

Crypto is down. I felt bad. Plus I have to go back to work, and all those rolled into a big sad feeling.

Crypto is up a little, so that glimmer of something positive helped. A little. I'm still not writing, or really planning things out. I've pretty much abandoned those when I sucked in all the news lately. I'm an empty husk; there's nothing substantial going on, and I've just been playing around in a paper town.

So to speak. Buying snacks again. Eating also helps a little.
