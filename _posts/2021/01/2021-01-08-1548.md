Goodbye by Emmylou Harris makes me feel so sad. I've kept sucking up news like a vacuum. Didn't do any work again. I'm feeling detached and disjointed. I want to settle back. Crypto is still up. Just waiting for the crash. I need to go up more. This is not agonizing yet, but it's close enough to keep my hopes at a low simmer.
