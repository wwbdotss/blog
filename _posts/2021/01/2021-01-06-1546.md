Day 14. I am so sensitive and emotional. I get caught up in the news, extrapolate the worst, and just feel mentally assaulted and exhausted and become overcome with fear. I couldn't concentrate and had to take a long walk today. I envisioned the end of the world and how I was going to have to move somewhere and couldn't escape and there's nowhere safe. Ridiculous. I couldn't maintain objectivity. Fear is blinding, holy shit. What a miserable day. Sunday of the vacation. Back to work tomorrow. The only thing left is for crypto to crash, then it's back to lousy normal. It's too cold. I haven't been able to relax.
