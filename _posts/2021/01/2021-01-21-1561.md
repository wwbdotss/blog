Scheduled dad for vaccination! The most useful thing I've done for dad probably.

Another self-exile from crypto. I'll wait until tomorrow and reset the alarm to 1500, which would still be nice. It's at 2000 now, and that could not happen for years. That's my first sell point though. At this rate, I won't have enough to buy a car this year. What a disappointment.

Didn't feel right all day. Worked intensely for two hours after dinner, to get something going. It sort of worked. I felt good enough after to watch vlogs and finish up the hella spicy tofu stew and purple rice. And drinking the fifth kombucha.

My eyes hurt from scratching yesterday. It's somewhere in the inner corner of my left eye. It stung when I put in some eyedrops. I've kept the windows closed for two days now to keep out whatever pollen's blowing around outside. I still feel some itch though. Spring is going to be so bad.
