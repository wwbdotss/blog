Strongly, strongly, don't want to work. Don't want to wake up when I don't want to. Don't want to sleep when I don't want to. I hate, hate it.

Should I sell at $2000/ETH? Just to have a little something? 10 ETH. I can use it to, I don't know, just buy things. Retail therapy. Yes, I'll do it. Just to have something happen.
