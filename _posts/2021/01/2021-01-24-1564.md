Don't like tomorrow because I don't know what will happen with dad's vaccination. It's an unknown. The worst case scenario is that we get denied at the center because of some stupid paperwork or procedure. Something that I didn't prepare for, or overlooked when signing up. It's doubly bad in that it would make all this anxiety about it even more worthless.

Over-arching all that is my anxiety about work; more specifically, upcoming work when I have to work with A, and business communication stuff where I have to work with my crappy code I hadn't bothered to clean up.

I can't do anything with crypto. I can't do anything about anything until I have 10X that number. This is stupid and crazy. I'm tired of spending so much energy thinking about it, and waiting for it. I'm drained. I've hooked up all my hope to this fantasy, and I'm empty and have nothing left. I can't keep holding forever. I don't know what I want to be over, so I can relax and start enjoying myself.
