Spicy Cheezits came in the mail. That was the highlight of today. I got reacquainted with how bad it feels to need to wake up for work. Because I'm not following crypto now, I've stopped waking up randomly at 5 or 6. So that pattern disappeared when it would have been most useful right now. Kombuchatown is pretty good. ETH still not at ATH. Every notification gets my hopes up.
