Watched vlog about the bungy jump in New Zealand, and all the memories came back. Stepping onto that platform was the scariest physical thing I've ever done.

Watched cabin building videos all day. Ordered some tofu stew and galbi. Was afraid of hurting my teeth wrestling and chewing around the bone in the short ribs.
