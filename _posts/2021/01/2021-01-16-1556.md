Days go by relentless. I'm watching a lot of cabin building in the woods videos. Reading The Three-Body Problem, and not quite getting into it. I don't like how the author describes every character as some prominent doctor or famous optometrist; it's this appeal to authority fawning over professions and status. That makes me dislike everyone the author is trying to make me like.

Feeling a little sick after the walk in the cold and fog today. Sneezing, runny nose. That's annoying.

Going to ignore crypto for a few days again, try to. I'll see how long I last.

I should not have drank that non-green milk tea. I'm going to stay up until 4 a.m. in bed because of it. Fuck.
