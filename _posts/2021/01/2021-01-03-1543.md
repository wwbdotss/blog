Day 11. Happy that I'm not working tomorrow. Unfollowed Lil Wayne because his football tweets trigger me that it's Sunday. $1000 ETH. I've done absolutely nothing but watch charts. I'm glad I have this free time to waste like this. This is so crazy. I need to figure out a better exit plan. I didn't have staking and defi when I made my first plan. They're game changers. Maybe. I can depend on staking rewards, but I still can't rely on the price attached to that fixed stream of ETH rewards. So that's not great. I don't trust defi either, but if I could, those double digit stablecoin yields are massive. I can abandon the 4% rule if defi matures. Also, since it's stablecoins, it doesn't go down in value. That is the super attractive part. A fixed income investment instrument that yields more than the stock market. Does smart contract risk really take up 9.5% of that premium?
