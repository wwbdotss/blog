Ate a whole pizza on the parkside bench. Feeling bad in general. Don't care about keeping myself away from crypto anymore. I give in. It's cold. I want to take a nap but it's too close to dinner time. Something is going to go wrong with the vaccination trip.

I'm going to go to Youtube hoping for some good videos and I'm going to be disappointed. This is guaranteed.

Yep.
