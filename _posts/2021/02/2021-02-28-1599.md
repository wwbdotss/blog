I can't control my emotions. They control me. I get consumed and there's nothing I can do. It's amazing how long it's taken me to realize this. I stayed up late playing Bloons and watching a Bloon stream. It's 1:13 a.m. and I'm not going to fall asleep any time soon.

Ate sushi and I didn't like it. I'm not going to buy mediocre sushi ever again. It's such a waste and I'm disappointed every time. It's high end sashimi and nigiri or Safeway rolls, no more spongy fish ever again.

I did eat the best fried chicken sandwich I've ever eaten at the local cafe. I got angry at V for dismissing it; that was when my petty emotions kicked in. I'm just tired of being excited to tell her something--"The chicken was so juicy!"--and having her reflexively diminish it--"Well deep-fried chicken is supposed to be juicy". It's annoying as fuck.

Just checked crypto because I'm depressed and it's up, and now I'm less depressed.

The important thing though is that I would get towed under by those emotions, and a little later, I always get wracked with regret over how I lost control, then later still I get over it, and feel glad how I would get upset and shut down, which means I don't do more damage at the heat of the moment. This also means nothing gets fixed and it'll happen again next time. But of course, I don't want to spend the energy and time to try to master my emotions through exposure and talking about it. So that is how it is right now.
