Trying to reset. Took a shower, it's 9 p.m. Overhead lights off. Music. Twitch and crypto overwhelming me. Texting with H and C. S texted me a picture of pho. I'm getting sick of texting. I want to see them for real and talk.

My to-do lists are a bust. I've just ignored them.

Maybe I should watch a movie. Or read. But I'm going to just check crypto.
