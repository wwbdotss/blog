Heavy rain, which was good. Don't like Chinese New Year because I have to interact with family in an out of ordinary way. I don't like holidays in general because of this change in expectation of my behavior. It's also an opportunity for dad to tell me to get a wife. I don't want to interact with him or anyone from my family because of this reason. Everything is about that one issue for me. Every gesture, every word, I'm on alert and waiting for it to come up. It's hell.

I'm so afraid of my anal bleeding. I really need to go to doctor but I don't want covid. Fuck. I also don't want to face the possibility I have cancer, and have that confirmed. The longer I wait, the worse it's going to get, of course. So that's where I am.

Crypto is tiring me out and taking too much of my attention and hopes and dreams. I need to take another break from it again. No crypto tomorrow.
