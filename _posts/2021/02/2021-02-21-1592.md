Played Civ, off the rush of nice energy I got after I finished off some minor work and felt Sunday open up, and it felt like Saturday for a little bit. Walked. Watched Fuslie stream. Didn't check crypto. I'm tempted now, at the end of the day.

Have two rivers to cross tomorrow. Dad hopefully is well enough to get his vaccine. And nothing goes wrong with the new work setup. I'll re-descend into crypto. The approach that could endure for the long term may be to avoid crypto during weekends.

Sleepy and tired now, from Civ and watching streams. The PC and big monitor actually, really takes a toll. I don't even want to watch movies or anything on it after a few hours. I might not want a big monitor after all if this is how I'm reacting to it. It wasn't like this before, either. Another part of getting old.
