Didn't blog Friday. Restarted Netflix and watched The Midnight Sky. It was ok. I liked it better than the book.

Set the PC up again because I miss a big screen and games. It's overwhelming after using laptops, in how loud the tower gets, and how bright the monitor is. I couldn't watch the ghost town Youtube channel on it without getting nauseated.
