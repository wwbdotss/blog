First aunt told me the girl she tried to set me up with got a boyfriend. I didn't act when others did, and so I'm left with the consequences of my passivity. This sucks, obviously, and I feel bad about how I keep wasting opportunities. It made me want to be better, fleetingly. It won't last though, and I'll be back to where I am. I don't know how to break out of it except with better discipline and constant self-motivating to do, to act, to move. I texted H and asked her to dim sum whenever we get vaccinated. It's an empty kind of gesture, like a lot of my interactions with her. I want to make this real, and ask her out and see where it goes. I can't keep living in my liminal world. I will buy a car. I will express myself and say what I feel. I want to live on the base layer of physical reality for once. I'm sick of my head. I need to change.
