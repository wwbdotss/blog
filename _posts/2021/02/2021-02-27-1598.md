Waking up has really sucked the past few months. I get anxious and feel bad about my life and dwell on my helplessness and all the suffering I have to go through. I don't think it used to be like this. And sometimes, often?, like this morning, I don't even feel rejuvenated. I have a headache, in fact, and it's terrible. I would wake up prematurely and try to go back to sleep and fail.

Voices and sounds stress me out now too. I hate hearing other people when they're talking on the phone. Dad's and V's voices in the background make me anxious. The descent continues.

I have no idea what to do today. In the morning, because I couldn't stand to stay in bed any longer after waking up at 8:50, I had some time to play Bloons, which was the only thing I wanted in the world. Then I finally washed the coins that were in my laundry detergent box. They are drying out now, and I'm looking forward to putting the other coins I had lying on top of my dresser into that container, which I couldn't before because it was full of soap, which was corroding the metal. I need to check off that list item.

I can't deal with passwords any more. It's so bad. I don't want to spend any more mental energy trying to pre-emptively outmaneuver hackers.

I need to also deposit a check at the bank, from the overpayment from the refinance. I've gone outside every day since Thursday.
