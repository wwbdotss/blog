I'm going to keep trying to ween myself off crypto. I don't have consistency to hold me back. I'll be happy to last a day without checking prices. I'm agitated today because I don't like unclosed circles. It's a ridiculous thing. Dad is kind of sick and might have to reschedule his vaccine appointment. That disrupted the nice tidy plan before where he would get the shot and I wouldn't have to worry about that part of my life anymore. Instead, now it's opened up to a prolonged, open-ended situation I have to actively devote focus and attention to. Also, R is coming to give me bread tomorrow. But she asked if she could come at 9 in the morning, when my baseline Sundays I sleep in. I'm so stuck in my routines that any slight deviation agonizes me. Even to make time to receive a gift from a friend is a problem. What the fuck is wrong with me. Of course, in the background, crypto is down, and removed itself as a source of fantasy for me, so I can't escape reality as easily. I ended up playing a lot of Bloons and watching Twitch, so ended up with a headache, and felt tired early, combined with my bad mood, and this is where I am now. Nothing bad has happened. Everything, *everything*, is in my mind, ruining my life.
