The whining of the PC case is really getting to me. The large monitor too. I'm not used to it anymore. They overstimulate me, and I have to turn them off and go back to my laptop before long. A quiet laptop is so important to me apparently. I'm going to buy the fanless MacBook Air because of this, holy shit.

Avoiding crypto today. Not too bad. Everything was down yesterday.

Shirking work like no one's business. I am so disassociated.

Can't find time to watch Netflix when all I want to watch is on Youtube.
