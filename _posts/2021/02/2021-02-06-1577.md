Finally sold some ETH after years. I don't have anything I want to do with the money except try to make more money with it. I didn't even portion off enough to top off my savings account.

The price is down a little now and I don't feel as bad, so selling did have some value.

Took a nap.

It seems like it's getting harder and harder. The money shuffling in the morning was fun, but it wore off so fast. I didn't sell enough to elicit a strong feeling. I don't know what to do now. The refinance is annoying buzz in the background, and it's bothersome. I need more income. I'm getting a smaller paycheck, and at the same time, the mortgage is going up, and I'm taking on more of the bills. I need to get part of the rent. I'll get them from V in batches I guess. Things are moving but nothing is to my advantage.

Fixed income is the best thing ever. I didn't realize how much seeing a steady stream, unaffected by market prices, makes me feel so good. It doesn't even matter that it's lower returns. Having gains cemented in place instead of things floating around at the whim of the market is super amazing. $1 a day is all I need.
