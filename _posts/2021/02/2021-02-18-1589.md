Boba kept me up last night, couldn't sleep for hours. Also, crypto is getting annoying. I hate myself for not being strong enough to stay away.

My butt is still at the top of my worries.

I had more energy after dinner today, so that was great. I did some work. I'm getting tired of Bloons too, so that'll be over soon.
