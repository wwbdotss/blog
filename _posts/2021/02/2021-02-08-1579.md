Got cashier's check. No problems. Crypto up.

V said her dad had a "neuropsychotic break" and being combative and uncooperative in the hospital. It pains me to think of all the stress that would put her through. I get stressed just thinking about it, and what would happen if it happened to my family.

Closing refinance tomorrow. Crypto will be up again tomorrow.
