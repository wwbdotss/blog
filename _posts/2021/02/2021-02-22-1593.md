Watched some Netflix. Witcher. It was so pointless. Ordered some salad, wasn't very good. Crypto down, I'm sad. It was great that dad got his second vaccine dose without a hitch. Also, finished the new project for work, so that's off my plate. Wasn't that bad. I'm glad I don't have to do it, long term. Didn't know what to do, and did random things online, watched streams, Youtube, whatever to fill the emptiness. Ordered more dip, also out of boredom. What's going to happen tomorrow?
