Played Bloons on the PC is great. Watched ghost town videos. I didn't reply to C's text asking if I had gotten spots for vaccination. I don't feel like answering and having to explain. Took a walk. Got a new phone. It doesn't improve my life whatsoever. It's nice to look at the even bezels, that's it.

I still only care about crypto. Relentless money-counting.
