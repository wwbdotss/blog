Watched Shaolin Soccer again. Kung Fu Hustle is much better. The Mermaid next.

I've not checked crypto all day. I get meta about it. I'm analyzing my reaction and craving to check, and let *that* be my entertainment. That, again, novelty is a reliable motivator. I bought a subscription to Asimov's, and I'm looking forward to issues every month. I should have done it earlier. More novelty!

I need to sell some YFI at a loss, to cut away some of the gains from moving it around so much. I predict I'll get this big drop this year, definitely. YFI is going to go down below $20,000. I need to set an alert. I'll withdraw it from the vault then, and forego the APY to save on taxes. It's so annoying.

The other scenario would be that ETH hits $3,500 and I can sell and pay off the YFI tax that way. Much preferable, of course.

The worst thing would be sideways the entire year, and I'll owe a lot of taxes, and probably be penalized for not paying estimated taxes. I should pay estimtated taxes, in my situation. I can't count on YFI falling to $20,000.
