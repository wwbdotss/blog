I'm going blind. Vision deteriorating. From stress maybe? I took a walk and got foam mango tea, which is an ok substitute for mango milk tea, which is what I really want. I also got a banh mi, and popcorn chicken. The cafe and sushi place, my first and second choices for some curry and a roll, respectively, were closed.

Crypto slightly up, or at least not down as much, so I feel slightly good. I'll feel better if BTC holds above $50,000. That's such a nice round number to mentally settle into.

H messaged me something, and I replied. I'm fond of any exchange.

Need more sleep. I keep waking up at 7 or 8.

Played more Bloons, still having fun.
