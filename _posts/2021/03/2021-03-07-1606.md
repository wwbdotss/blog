I am so irritated right now. IRS didn't accept my taxes yet, which they usually do within the hour. It's got to do with crypto. And I still have to amend it because I forgot to include the brokerage account. Fuck. I hate things being in limbo, open ended, unclosed, dangling, dragging out. I can't rest. It means I have to spend more energy being on alert. I can't rest.

On top of that, it's Sunday and I don't want to go to work.

The OA sucked so bad. It's the exact opposite of what I wanted. There's no eth in here! It's not sci-fi. It's a goddamn stupid story about a crazy person, the very type of story I can't stand. I'm actually pissed.

Oh, there IS ether in the second season. I'll just read the synopsis.
