There is something intolerable about regular life. I want to escape from it. It's all I think about. I don't want to be here. It's why financial independence and crypto are so attractive to me.

What really is going to happen this year. Will I get a car? Will I move out? I haven't thought about what I would need financially to happen in order for me to move out. I need ETH to hit $3,500 for the car, but I haven't set any concrete number or trigger for the move. What would I need? Could I afford to pay both mortgage and rent? V would pay for half the mortgage. Rent in the South Bay would be about $2,000. I can afford it if I don't save anything. I will gladly make that trade. The bad part would be work. I'll definitely be more stuck than ever. Not stuck stuck, I guess, I will have no problem moving back home if I get fired. I'm also mentally braced to not quit until ETH hits $10,000. Within 5 years. So no quitting this year. No quitting next year. Where will things be in 2023?

I predict I will buy a car this year. ETH hits $3,500. 2022 will be a down year. I can see it back down where it is now for the entire time, and will not break the high of 2021. 2023 will either spike up to $10,000 and I can GTFO, or stay down. 2024 is too far away. If 2023 is still bad, 2024 will be better.

I'm going to waste and whither away the rest of my thirties. I don't have a plan outside of crypto. That is not good.
