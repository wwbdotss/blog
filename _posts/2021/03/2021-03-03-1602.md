A need to call PGE ruins my day. I so overreact and my life is way too fragile. I break at every opportunity, emotionally, physically, anything. I bought some Szechuan food and I will never buy more. The noodles are too spicy and too glutenous. The cabbage thing is weird. The tofu crab dish is also weird and thick. I still have some day old popcorn chicken I feel bad about eating. My eyes are still deterioting. I'll stop playing so much Bloons. I didn't play that much today, and my eyes are still red, feel strained, and everything is blurry. Crypto is sideways, so I can use that as a source of relief. I feel so poor. Paying all the bills for this house is hella expensive.

I feel pretty bad all around.
