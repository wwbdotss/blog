Raining more. Watched Kung Fu Hustle. It was good. I liked it. Going to rewatch Shaolin Soccer, and want to see The Mermaid later too. I'm avoiding crypto for a day, or until the alert goes off.

PC can't output video again. It must be the motherboard, or maybe the power supply died again. This is so stupid. I don't care about maintaining computers anymore. I just want it to work.
