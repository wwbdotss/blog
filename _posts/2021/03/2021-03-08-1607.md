Woke up to my tax return getting accepted. w00t. That made me feel a lot better. Back to normal. Amending it is not that bad in comparison. I could still get audited, but I've kept reasonably good books so I'm not afraid. I do owe like $15,000 in taxes this year for moving YFI around. Oops.

Talked to B a little, at the end of a work call. I liked the conversation.
