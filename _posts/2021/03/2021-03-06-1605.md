Really dug into the crypto taxes. It's annoying as fuck. I don't know what the prices are. Does anyone know what the prices are??? I took a walk. Bought the chicken sandwich from the cafe again. Delicious. Got boba but had to wait a long time, and wasn't pleased. Mango foam was pretty good, and I'll get it sweeter next time.

I can't wait to finish taxes so I can see how much cash buffer I need. If I have enough, I'll buy more crypto. I want more, more!

Going to watch more Netflix. Start on the OA maybe, because they show ether in it.
