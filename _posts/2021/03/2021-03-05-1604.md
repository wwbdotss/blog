Started doing taxes. I didn't blog today, like a lot of Fridays, so don't remember what happened. I threw away most of the Szechuan food. The weird cabbage dish was the one I liked the most. The noodles not at all. The crab tofu is still in the fridge and I'm definitely throwing that out. I got some boba delivered. It's so bad. Paid $25 for two drinks. It's *so* bad. The signature brown sugar milk tea was just OK. The mango sago was great.

H texted me. It's nice. Watched campy B movie on Netflix, Time Trap, which I'm going to do some more. It was entertaining.
