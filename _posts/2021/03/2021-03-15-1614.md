Felt terrible today. Something is definitely wrong. Can I put off going to the doctor until I get vaccinated? It's the risk miscalculation of my life. I couldn't stop jittering this morning. Work was terrible too. Things didn't gel. I feel scattered and nothing's cohering. I had to take a walk. I didn't feel that much better. It was so cold. I'm tired of being so cold. Right after dinner, I went to bed. I'm up now, after about three hours, still feeling kind of crappy. I drank the rest of the mango sago, and ate some chili pistachios. Some of my finger tips hurt. I have nothing to do right now. Nothing on Twitch, or Youtube, or Twitter, or the random sites. What do I do? I can read. I don't want to read the sci-fi books anymore. Not now at least. Murakami, ok.
