Ferry building. Wandered around a little before she got there. Tried to find a good place to eat. Some places were closed for general maintenance, including one Japanese deli place that looked good. Hog Island Oyster had a huge line.

S came, and we decided to go to Osha Thai. Got chicken noodle soup, which was the second cheapest dish at $15. I wasn't expecting much, but it the dish came out in a nice thick bowl, nice presentation with sauce and garnish. She got eggplant.

Tested her app for a while. This was the part I wasn't looking forward to. A lot of communication I didn't want to do. It turned out ok though.

It turned out better than I thought. It was better than last time. Conversation wasn't great. Same old topics. I didn't feel like myself either, as always with her. There were a couple of bright spots, like when we got ice cream and walked through Sur la Table.

I didn't get to go to Tang Bar. I'm craving it now.

Dad is hiring someone to look after grandma, which is good. I don't know when first aunt is going to really come back.
