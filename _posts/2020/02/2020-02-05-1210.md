Caspian was great. I was thinking I might not go because of the hassle and whatever, and that was bullshit, I would have totally missed out. Going to shows is still amazing. It's a time for me to lose myself in the music. I don't have to think about anything because the music is so goddamn loud. I sat up in balcony this time, and it was so much better than being on the floor. No crowd, I could sit when I want, and I have an unobstructed view of the stage and the crowd. So good, I'm totally going to go up there from now on.
