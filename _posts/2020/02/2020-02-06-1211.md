Good day at work because the meeting I was down there for got moved. I had free time just being around my coworkers. Lunch with A and A. It was fun riding in A's big ass truck. A put a calendar invite for lunch next week already. I love the attention and getting invited to things. B also asked me for lunch, but I had agreed to go with A already, so I felt bad for not going with her. She had earlier pulled me aside to talk about some work thing, then we talked about traveling again.

G sent out an email saying that he would understand if people cancelled their flights to his wedding in Japan. I will very likely say I won't go. I don't want to travel at all right now.
