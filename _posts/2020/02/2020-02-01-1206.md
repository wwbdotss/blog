I cancelled on S. I don't want to do anything tomorrow.

Dinner with C tonight. Talking with her exhausts me after a while. I like walking her home. We ate at a small brunch place that served Italian food for dinner. At first there was nobody there and I didn't want to eat there, but then we were just early. It filled up soon. Then we went to Lori's. I got pancakes and she got apple pie and coffee.
