C is texting me a lot, which is great. She's texted me every day for the past week. I want to keep it going. She's pretty much my best hope for a girlfriend right now. I don't know.

I got disgusted watching a stream today and decided to just stop watching Twitch, again. It's an ultimatum day. I deleted Twitch and Instagram from my phone, again. I'm not going to watch any streams for as long as I could. It didn't last very long last time, but I'll see. This led to the usual purge of Reddit, which I deleted again. I'm going to avoid crypto, again. I feel pretty good. Clean again.

I feel pretty sleepy, also good. It's only 8:30.

I'm actually writing. At least, editing. Feels good. All because I organized the folder.
