Ate the pot pie at Boudin's. So inferior to KFC, it's not even funny. More expense, less of it, and not as tasty.

Allergies are hitting hard.

Spent first half of work at cafe near the police station. Jasmine tea, croissant, then salad. Pee at library. Had a choice between West Portal and Stonestown, chose Stonestown. It having wifi and places to sit there decided it for me. I was still supposed to be working. I also like that route.

Slept horribly last night. Was still up at 3:30. The large matcha at 4 pm really did me in. I was also fantasizing about all sorts of things, so that didn't help.

I will try so hard not to do these cafe days anymore. The disassociated feeling I get wandering around the afternoon is not worth the extra sleep. I need to get the fuck up and go to the office to work.
