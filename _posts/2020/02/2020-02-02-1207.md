Diner with dad, grandma, and V. Good.

Didn't do any work, like I wanted. Also good?

I got matcha at the mall and got Tang noodles, watching Lily stream. It was hella windy. Gross. Home for dinner.

Another zero day.

C told me she still got dizzy after waking up. I told her to ask her doctor. She said she doesn't have enough other symptoms for the doctor to go off of. I started getting riled up to reply, but then I got deflated and had no interest getting into it. She can do what she wants. I apparently don't care enough to intervene.
