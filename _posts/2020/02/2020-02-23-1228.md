Walked to and back from Blue Danube. No more ants there. Kombucha and half sandwich and salad combo. That might be better than the usual regular salad. The combo's side salad is pretty big already.

I wrote in my notebook journal and read the OTV subreddit. I can't resist celebrity news apparently.

Texted C. She then told me L was coming to visit. Set up a date for lunch. Best thing to happen today. Very social and productive.

Watched more LilyPichu streams when I got back.

V had been watching grandma all day. I can't wait for first aunt to come back next week. I don't know what we would do without her. This is insane. It's literally impossible to take care of old family members without help.

Going to try to sleep early to commute tomorrow. I at least feel sleepy enough and it's only just after 10.
