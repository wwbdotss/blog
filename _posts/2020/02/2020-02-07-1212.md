Got some fruit from the grocer around the corner from work. I should go there more often. They also random had biltong, which was good, but I felt gross after eating a bag and a half of it. Eating the berries and tomatoes felt great though.

Spent most of the day at work not doing work. Streams and reddit. Then I went home early to buy pizza for dinner. Two mediums. Combo and BBQ chicken. Dad seemed to like it. Grandma didn't complain and seemed to like it too. It was pretty good. From Strada. $50 for two medium pizzas. I guess margins are pretty great.

Meeting S on Sunday after cancelling on her last week.
