Scheduled two dinners with C. It feels easy to meet up with her.

State Bird Provision and Oza Oza. Fancy places are prohibitive to me eating alone.

Whiplash crypto. Everything went up hella in the two days I willed myself to ignore it. Missed out on the hype. And now that I'm back, the next month will be bleeding back.

It's feeling like 2017 again. My eyes just keep popping.

B checked if I would be in the office tomorrow. She has pie. Feels good!
