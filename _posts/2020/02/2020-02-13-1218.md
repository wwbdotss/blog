Good day at work because I got to interact with people. A brought cake. B brought me a slice of apple pie from yesterday. Got curry with A and A for lunch. A is leaving for another job. I'm so sad. T's friend gave me a ride in his Tesla. That actually got me kind of motion sick. It felt roomier than I thought. The acceleration was quick. Lastly, played Bananagrams before leaving. Felt gross sleeping on the bus.

Looking forward to tomorrow when I can get more Tang Bar.
