Sad that A is leaving. Last day at the office not counting offsite tomorrow. Work sucks. There are more people I don't like than ever.

Got boba for A at the end of the day, that was good at least. I still haven't talked to her for real. Everything seemed to be offhand conversations. Nothing real. It's going to remain this way. This won't change tomorrow at the winery offsite and dinner after. How do I make a solid connection and really talk and listen to someone?

Still editing more. Finishing older stories and just wrapping them up, bad or not. I just want to have complete thoughts. Want to really take an idea, rough it out, and just write and finish a story from beginning to end. Bringing something into creation. Feels good.

First aunt will come back tomorrow. That will be awesome.

I'm fascinated by what the coronavirus is going to do. No fear, only intense curiosity. I want to see how far stocks fall, and how fucked up things get. This is entertainment, real world pandemic. It's happening.
