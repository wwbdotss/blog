Got into office at 11:30. I could not get out of bed at 8, not a chance. It's going to happen again tomorrow.

Watched streams all day at work. Didn't do anything at all. Cut my nails. Got haircut. Ordered something new at the bun bo hue place; noodle soup with clams. It was bad. So disappointed. It was at least a new thing. I looked forward to second lunch. Got Super Duper, chicken sandwich with portobello, fries.

Worked after dinner.

Didn't look at crypto.
