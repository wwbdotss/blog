Didn't meet up with B and E and whoever. E guessed it was cancelled. Weird. Can't say I wasn't relieved to hear it. My anti-socialness is always up for cancelled events. It would have made my day better though. I went to Stonestown and wasted time. I read back past entries on this day last year, then the year before that, and the one before that. They were all gloomy as fuck. This entire journal is just me depressed and venting. There is nothing good here to remember or look back on. It's not a reading sort of journal, only the spilling sort.

I started watching Watchmen to get into stories again. I need it.

Finished it. It was OK and weird.
