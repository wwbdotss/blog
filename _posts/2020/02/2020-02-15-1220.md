Day at home watching grandma. Usual lunch. Fish filet porridge, salmon fried rice, turnip cake.

Took a small walk. Finally went to the empanadas place. Hipster af. Small little hot pocket. It was good though. I'll be back for sure to try the other flavors.

Stayed up thinking a lot about crypto last night. I get hella euphoric like that sometimes, it's weird.

Took a bad nap.

C texted me about her relatives. I texted back one message for every like seven of hers.

Oh, did my taxes.
