I feel better about B and things today. It is what it is.

C texted me and it was the best thing today. She asked if she had gotten me sick.

I got some KFC, they have donuts + tender strips now. I got some nacho fries, which was good.

Glad I can sleep in a little for work because I don't have to commute. I'll probably go to Rolling Out. Oatmeal, green tea, croissant, shepherd's or chicken pot pie. That sounds pretty good.

Organizing my writing folder makes me want to write.
