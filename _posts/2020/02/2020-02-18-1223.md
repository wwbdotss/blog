I need to try harder to not sleep in and spend the day working out of a cafe. It's terrible. My day's in pieces.

Something is still biting me. I shouldn't walk through Stern Grove during the spring. It's fucking annoying

Watched streams when I should be working, it's so bad.

I didn't try anything new today. Didn't even think about it.

Going down to Sunnyvale tomorrow. Ugh.

Still can't stand interacting with J at work.
