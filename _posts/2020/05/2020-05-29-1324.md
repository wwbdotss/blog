It's been the longest stretch I haven't blogged I think. This week has just been a haze. Civ. Streams. Work. Lunch and dinner. I don't feel anything but a flat malaise.

I'm worried about V's job because she might get laid off. I'm as anxious and pessimistic about my job. I don't feel secure at all and have an inferiority complex.

Crypto's up. I'm still thinking about buying more now that I have my emergency fund filled up. I don't want to put that extra money into stocks. I've dutifully done that for my retirement account and after all these years and a record decade of growth, the results are kind of meh. The best the stock market can do is so underwhelming. I don't know how I would handle a long-term sideways boring as fuck trend. I realize that about my risk tolerance now. It's interesting. I don't care about losing money or a big fall in prices. The only thing I super hate and want to avoid is flat or no activity where nothing happens. That is the scenario that would make me want to sell and do something reckless out of sheer boredom. So not risk averse as much as boredom averse.

Taking Monday off.
