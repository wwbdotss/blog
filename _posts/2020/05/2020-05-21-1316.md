I'm so tired. Work is stupid. The annoying inflamed tastebud is ruining everything. I need my appetite to move forward, it's that vital. It gives me something concrete and short term to look forward to, and I know for a fact I will get satisfaction from eating and satisfying the hunger. Now my tongue is fucking irritated and I can't enjoy eating and I can't enjoy my appetite.
