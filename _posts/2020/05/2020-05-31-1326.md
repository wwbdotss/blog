Ordered beet salad from Barney's the burger place. And some chili and fried pickles. Wanted to try something new. The pickles were hella salty.

Got big headache playing Civ and watching a stream with lots of people talking. I should not do that anymore. Sensory overload.

Sound really affects me, in general. I am so sensitive. I fall in love with anyone with a good voice. I'm instantly on alert if I hear something out of place. I monitor constantly the sounds of people around me.

Went to bed early because of the headache.
