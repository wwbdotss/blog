Worked. There was a super great moment right after I got the email that my template worked. It felt amazing. Like soft bells ringing, but a tacile version instead of sound. The future opened up in front of me and I could enjoy whatever I was going to do. It was so great. Of course, it needed the preceding mystery and stress of not knowing how it would turn out to life up the moment. Without having gone through the bad stuff, it would not nearly have felt as good. That's true for a lot of things I guess. Life in general, probably. I just need to make myself care more when I'm going through the hard parts that they are necessary parts of the good that would come after. Not always, of course, but the only way is through effort.

I ordered ramen from Walmart and don't know if I got scammed. These third-party sellers are hella sketchy. I probably just paid $12 for one cup of instant ramen.

Played Civ and watched streams all day long.
