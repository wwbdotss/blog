Five years at work. I told C, I don't like how it feels. I feel old and boring. It's not an achievement as much as it is a failure to grow.

I felt really lonely at first. I watched the latest OTV clip video, the drunk stream one, and the ending selfie and outro music hit my heart. Super effective editing.

I ended up in a music listening mood, and it's pretty nice. Eating guacamole with a spoon.

Today was also the third halving. Bitcoin seems more significant because of it.
