It was a good Saturday as well. Good mood continues. I woke up early at 8:30 even though I slept past 2. At first, I was annoyed I didn't get enough sleep, but then I got out of bed and it was fine. I took advantage and walked to Andytown to get a Snowy Plover drink. I got the huckleberry flavored one and it wasn't as good as the original. Played Civ and watched streams all day. Ordered $100 of Hard Knox food. Crawfish etoufee, shrimp salad, and mashed potatoes for me, and jamalaya and fries for V. Cornbread wasn't on the menu because it was included for free, which was nice.

I still haven't watched Survivor. Probably won't for a while. Youtube is easier.
