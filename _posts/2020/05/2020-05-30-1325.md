Tonight was especially bad for some reason. I was restless. I couldn't concentrate. No interesting in anything. Couldn't play Civ, watch Twitch, YouTube, crypto, reading, Survivor, nothing.

I have nothing to eat. I can't motivate myself to buy anything online. I'll do that now, but I have to make myself.

I went for a walk earlier, and that actually felt like a chore. I had to put on a mask, and I hated seeing people around, their presense made me have to walk around them to avoid passing them. I couldn't go anywhere farther because I couldn't stop to get food. I miss the mall. Miss cafes. Miss West Portal. Miss Japantown. Today was the worst day of the quarantine, for sure. I just felt trapped.

I'm going to buy queso.

I started buying things off my list and now I feel better and want to do things again. It's bizarre. I bought a $20 nail clipper. I'm tired of crappy nail clippers I get from wherever. Felt decisive and in control when I pick something intentionally. Got more Better Booch, gum, and dark chocolate granola bars. I also bought 5 black masks. It's going to be a part of what I wear outside like my cap.

Watching sliceofmatt videos on the laptop. Feels nice.

I also found a nice simple to do list app that does a lot of what I want and no clutter. It feels good to use. I'm in a better mood now.
