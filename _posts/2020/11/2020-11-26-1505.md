Hot pot thanksgiving with dad, V, first aunt, and grandma. It was good.

This week off has felt great. It doesn't feel like it's going by too fast at all. It's only Thursday, and it definitely feel like it's been this many days into the break. I don't feel like I'm getting cheated out of my time.

All crypto all the time. Something is going to happen that will make me stop this. Tragedy. I felt really clean buying more DOT and spending all my money. I already want to buy more. It's ridiculous. That's way too much and I should regret it. It's too bad I don't. No more buying. This will be a hard stop.
