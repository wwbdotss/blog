Used the electric blanket. It worked. I hate how I restrain myself from moving so as to not bend the wires. I'm sure they can tolerate it, but it's the same OCD that makes me not want to lie on top of blankets, which would compress the air out of them and make them less efficient. I can understand how things like that can overwhelm people.

Ate cup ramen, which I had been looking forward to and hadn't been able to find the right time to. 5 cups out of 6. One left. I'm surprised I haven't eaten them all yet. I need to get another flavor. Something salty sharper, so to speak.
