It's time to not check crypto again. I would still read Crypto Twitter, but need to stop checking prices.

I'm barren, all out. I don't know what to do.

Tongue doesn't hurt anymore, awesome. Ribs still hurt. I can't exercise. I'm reading Rhythm of War and the slog's started already. Skimming. Listening to Mono's Sorrow. Have an almost empty bag of Jolly Ranchers gummies, tasty. Walked a little at first to do *something*. It didn't feel that great. The low sharp sun. I just walked around the big block, really didn't go anywhere, literally around in a circle.

In my future, I have some queso and Youtube travel videos. It's really bleak.

Sunday tomorrow.

I finished the light updates to the site. It's pretty good. I've put that corner to order. My mind eases slightly.
