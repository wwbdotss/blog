Worked hard and it didn't matter to anybody. I'm glad I figured it out. That took a lot of thinking. $linkData was being initiated as new objects that didn't include the URLs, so every time the loop iterated, the URLs from the previous iteration were reset. Setting the URLs right after that, then adding the object to the $linkData array didn't matter because $linkData was reset at the start of the next iteration. I'm still not entirely clear how the third iteration could change the first iteration, say, but declaring a new $linkData = {} at the start, then adding in each object variable individually worked.

My ribs still hurt. I healed from a broken collarbone faster than this, what the hell.

BTC still not ATH. The wait is annoying. It was awesome getting staking awards though.
