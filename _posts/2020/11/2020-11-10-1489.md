Electric blanket is part of my fortress against biology. Can't wait to never be cold getting into bed. Dad turned on the heat so it's not as critical, but oh well.

Crypto is up again and I'm enjoying seeing numbers go up. I need to break that for crypto alone to beat ATH. It'll crash back any time now. Mentally, I cut that number in half for a baseline net worth.

Thinking maybe I don't need to sell my main ETH stack. Just stake forever? Definitely don't feel like selling YFI. There's so much activity going on behind the scenes. The price itself is not really top of mind it seems. Interesting.

Work was just barely there today. I didn't do anything, and I didn't plan for anything, and didn't talk to anyone, and I'm completely checked out.
