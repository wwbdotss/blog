Walked a little. Got green milk tea and my theory is right, and confirming again; green tea boba does not keep me up like black tea or that other kind used in HK style does. Matcha green tea...I need that again. I've forgotten.

Anxious about preflight meetings, because of public speaking and interacting with people and having to think on my feet and the big unknown of something bad happening and not knowing what to do on the spot. I will never get over them. It's bizarre how that works. It's not part of the usual path where exposure and experience help. They don't. It doesn't get any better. Like going to parties. I see my curve vividly. I've felt it so many times. I get anxious leading up to it. Once I'm there, I set my footing and feel the surge of sociability and everything's great. I want to be there and glad to be talking to people and having a great time. This is so short-lived. Like half an hour at most. Then I peak, and I slow, and fall off a cliff. I'm tired and exhausted and don't want to talk anymore and want to leave. It probably happens one minute to the next, it's that sudden. Then afterward, I'm glad I went, and go on to dread the lead up to another event.

Slept relatively early.

I did work on my sphere story. Planning. Never going to get the writing part.
