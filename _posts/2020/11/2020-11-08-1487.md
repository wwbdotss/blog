Crypto is up too!

Happiest I've been in months. Years? Right now, this moment, nothing going on for work. Nothing going on with family. Money going up. I can spend all day reading anything I want to online now without needing to avoid any topic. Gleefreshing! It takes so little to make me feel good. I just want nothing bad to happen, and the smallest positive thing is bonus and cake. Also, tomorrow is PTO, so even today being Sunday means nothing. Also also, still texting with C.

It's hella cold. I bought an electric blanket.
