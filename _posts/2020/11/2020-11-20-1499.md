Bite my tongue eating curry fish balls really fast because I got hella hungry on a walk. Hard to eat things now.

Finished work things, and felt amazing afterward, especially on that walk, minus biting the tongue thing. Got mango boba too.

Crypto still up. Bought DOT. I feel weird good about that for no reason. I can't wait to stake it, even with the taxes.

This moment right now, I'm happy.

Watching Kara and Nate travel videos, Friday night, crypto up, no problems with family, wrapped up work, Thanksgiving week off work, texts with H, no more Trump as president, Rhythm of War on my desk, just feeling at peace.
