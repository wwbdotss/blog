My little tongue scratch thing is ruining a lot. My appetite's gone and I can't go through the hunger-satiation cycle. I don't want to eat anything because it hurts. This is fucking bullshit.

I went to sleep hella early at 7 or 8 p.m. because I was super tired from watching Youtube videos for some reason, and I didn't want to deal with the cold either. Electric blankets are useless out of bed, and I don't even think it's that helpful in bed. I have nothing to watch or do, and I just wanted oblivion.

I brushed my teeth cursorily. I didn't want to deal with the whole night routine. I didn't shower either. I went to bed, woke up at 3:47 a.m. and kind of drifted, and ultimately got out of bed at 11 a.m. The whole thing was stupid and pointless.
