I'm just so cold. Can't wait for the electric blanket to come.

Only going to look at the news once a week. And crypto prices too. There is no finality here from which I can derive comfort.

Hate having to go back to work tomorrow. Will need to ask for more time off. Two and a half more weeks until Thanksgiving I guess. Then a month until Christmas.
