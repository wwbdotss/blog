I hurt my rib today reaching to adjust my blinds with my legs crossed, and wedged my torso against the desk's edge. My body is falling apart! My tongue is still not healed and getting in the way of me enjoying food. It sucks. I ordered a bunch of groceries tomorrow too, so hope it heals somewhat.

I'm freezing. I don't like the feeling of the electric blanket on me. I feel like I can't move freely, like every movement allows cold air to rush in, so I try to stay still and I can't last a minute before I fidget. I can't really sleep with it either. I think I should just lie on it, under the sheets so there's no chance of tangling it up. It's the kind I'm pretty sure I can't lie on top of. The only thing I can really do with it is to warm my bed up a bit before I sleep. I have to take it out because I can't deal with it in bed the same way I can't deal with it on my chair. The warnings about not folding or crumpling up the wires stop me from moving around as much I want to. I hella fidget in bed too. An electric sleeping mattress pad might be what I want.

A great Sunday because no real work tomorrow. I still have to do a meeting, but that's it. And then even after Thanksgiving break, I don't really have any immediate threats, so that Sunday should feel pretty ok too.
