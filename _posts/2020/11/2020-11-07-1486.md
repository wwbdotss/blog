That's pretty great! Woke up to cheering outside.

I spent the day pretty much reading every news outlet that I had avoided the past four years. It's so sweet.

Walked through the park on the way to the dentist. It was warm and nice and people out. I basked in the sun.

I have another thing to worry about from the dentist, so that sucked. Receding gums around my implant, which I thought was invincible and I didn't have to think about anymore. Everything is impermanent apparently, and I can't count on anything staying put.

Pretty good night sleep. Feels good to not have to worry about Trump.
