Still hating on my tongue. Crypto is down, so I can't find entertainment and distraction there today, which saddens me. I took a dull walk. It was cold and sunny and slightly windy and dry outside. Disgusting. I listened to Dan Carlin and the episode was bleak. What a bad flimsy day.

I want to just take a nap now and not have to experience this. I hate hearing V's phone calls for work and in general. I don't like the feel of headphones clamping my head either. I don't like hearing dad in the next room, I don't want to hear anything. I want to be alone and in silence.

What am I looking forward to then? For my tongue to heal so I can eat all the crap I bought. For BTC to cross ATH so I can stop paying attention. For Friday to see my DOT stake rewards, which I have very low confidence in. I'm still glad I bought them, but they look more and more like longshots. Like reddit coins. It was useful at least to feel that spike of thrill when I signed up for Kraken and bought it. Now I have another bag to carry for years and years. I do feel like hibernating. That's the way to go.
