I can count on all the unpleasant feelings that rise up when dad pushes me on dating. 100% fury and resentment and helplessness and expansive tendrils snatching at and digging at bad memories and exposing raw nerves. What the fuck. My life would be 99% better if this one thing disappeared. I can't and don't want to communicate to try to fix it. That's the problem. I'm not going to. I don't care. It's him wanting to impose his will on me, and that is one thing I can't stand. I get so irritated at even little things like that from other people. It's setting my head on these bad tracks, and I don't want to waste any more time and energy thinking about this. I don't need more stress that doesn't resolve. This is the worst Friday night before a three day weekend, what the fuck. I can't calm down. I can't be ever happy or free.

It's easier to not check crypto. Crypto is really at its core, pretty stupid.

What am I going to do tonight, with all this luxurious time I have. Don't want to eat any more Epic. V doesn't want it either.

More travel vlogs. That's kind of it. I have nothing else to do. Listen to podcasts? I only want to do that when I'm walking.
