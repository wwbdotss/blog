Tomorrow is going to suck because it's Sunday and I will need to work to catch up because I had put it off. It's 1:12 a.m. and I don't want the day to end and become Sunday.

I read a post that made me think I'm living cautiously. Is that how I want to go through life? So what if I lose everything? I have no faith in myself handling unexpected circumstances. I feel like I have to mitigate and plan and avoid as much as possible. My adaptive muscles haven't developed and are atrophied, and I'm not equipped to handle life as it comes. I have to duck and dodge and crane and jerk my neck around to try to spot every danger so I don't have to deal with anything head-on, and always flee and withdraw. I'm so used to that flight mode, I don't even notice it. It's really true. It's why I'm refreshing charts all day long. It's why I fantasize about early retirement, and updating spreadsheets, and not doing anything because I'm biding and waiting for perfect conditions before I make any move. I'm afraid. I'm afraid I'll be homeless if I mess up and not keep the lookout and run through preparations in my mind. It's why I hate homeless people so much because they remind me what I fear.

What do I do about that?
