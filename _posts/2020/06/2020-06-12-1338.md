Video called C, K, and L. It was so stark how differently I felt throughout. At first, I was hella excited and energetic and wanted to talk. Then I fell off a cliff in the second part. I got irritated and quiet and didn't want to say anything and wanted to get away. Then the third part, I felt better again and engaged again and was glad I had friends to talk to. That was the most volatile progression I've seen from me before. It's happened before in other social interactions, but not nearly as violent. I would start off pretty social, then notice that I tamper off. Last night was a bonafide rollercoaster. I got whiplash.

C was talkative and energetic the entire time I think, which I need to figure out how to emulate. She took full advantage of the call and was very present and caught up with K and L. L seemed good. Even temperment. K doesn't care about corona and going to Vegas. E was too high to get on, which is hilarious.
