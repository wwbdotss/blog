I've been lazy about blogging. I stay up late playing Civ and watching streams and then I go straight from shower and bathroom to bed without writing anything. It's mostly because of Civ. It would take an really good stream for me to stay up til 2. With Civ, it's hella easy.

I dream of taking two weeks off and play Civ in a hotel room again. Denver was pretty great.
