I scheduled another video call with E, C, K, and L for Friday. It's the most productive and social thing I've done since the last call two weeks ago.

My leg feels better. I walked to Tea Hut and got a red bean smoothie because I'm afraid of caffeine. Stonestown is open again. Hmmm. Everything is still so strange out there.
