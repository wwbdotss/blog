Didn't check Kevin's Noodle House. Walked to Peasant Pie, got beef and potato for V, clam and tomato and curry for me. Got super salty as usual cajun chicken salad at Cafe Flores. Also got boba from random tea place. Okinawa flavored, which didn't taste special.

Video call with C, L, and E. I don't want to do another one of these. Conference calls suck. I don't get much out of it. It has the obligations of a real meetup without the real physical qualities of being next to people in space. Not a fan.

Played more Civ. I like my cheap trackpad keyboard a lot. It feels nicer to use and have than the wired mechanical keyboard. It's also easy to move around, which is the best part. It feels nice to reject fashion and have actual reasons behind my choices.
