The end of today was pretty bad too. Listless. No motivation. The same strong sunset light through the blinded windows. Slight headache. No energy after work. Watching empty Minecraft streams. Even guacamole didn't have the same attraction. I really need to cut my hair. It's gotten annoying.

Right now, I'm going to eat some artichoke and spinach hummus and watch sliceofmatt youtube videos, then go to sleep. I got up at 10 today even though I slept at 11 last night. So pointless.
