Felt the best I have felt for a while. It's the classic Saturday morning joy and it's back. I have my playlist. I woke up feeling rested. I didn't have to pay attention to anything family related. I wanted to fix my spreadsheet, and watch videos, and play games, and eat. There's motivation. Nothing terrible happened in the recent past to dog my memory. Nothing bad in the immediate future to stress me out. I have a nice bubble up and enjoying the morning.

Played a lot of civ. Took a walk. Ordered Hard Knox. The crawfish etoufee is not salty, which is interesting.
