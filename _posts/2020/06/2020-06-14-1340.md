Woke up with panic and distress, the usual on Sunday. I always feel anxious with dad and family around. I feel the need to monitor and be ready in case something bad happens to them, like I'm on call and standby every waking hour. I'm waiting for him to bring up me not having a girlfriend, no car, no brand name clothes, and just random attempts to change my life. It fucking sucks to live at home. I'm never at ease. The cumulative stress will manifest somehow. Cancer. Mental collapse. Something will happen, sooner or later.
