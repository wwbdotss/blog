Things feel weird. It's primarily the disruption in Offline TV schedule. It feels off. Yvonnie's story about her sexual abuse and then sudden meetings and lack of streams just all make me feel unsettled. And this is just random streamers' lives I have no connection to. It's a hundred times worse when it comes to real people around me. I need everything to be in their place and any tiny variation messes me up. I can't survive in this world. I need everything to stay put.

I took a nap and felt worse afterward. During, I had vivid pieces of dreams. A lot of them cramped into the two hours or so I was in bed at the edge of consciousness.

Took tomorrow off. I bet something will still come up.

I plan to walk to Irving and get some peasant pies. Check out how Kevin's Noodle House is doing. Boba yes.
