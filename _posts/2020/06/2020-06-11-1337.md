Today wasn't 1337 at all. What a waste.

K texted that he was going to get laid off in October, which sucks. I didn't reply yet because I was caught up in Minecraft stream drama, which is exactly as degenerate as it sounds. It wasn't even explicit drama raised to that level. It was made-up drama in my mind based off of nothing at all but some perceived series of events. I'm far gone.
