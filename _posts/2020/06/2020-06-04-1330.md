Went to bed and got up early, for the second straight day! I had a terrible night of sleep though, and I don't feel that great now. I'm glad I have the extra time right now. I learned instantly yesterday that I should not fill it with work. Instantly. I want to spend the time writing; that seems like the natural thing, to go back to it. But right now, blogging feels the best, and what I want to do. Reflect before the day starts. I feel different, with this change in schedule, and that's really all I want to experience. I don't feel immediate panic and misery like before. At least now, two days in, I look around and wonder what to do, feeling uncertain with this new patch of time.

I can also afford to feel like this because there's nothing immediate at work I have to do, so that definitely helps with the tranquility. I bet work will intrude into this space before long.

I should write.

I have no interest in the news or Twitter at all. I'm done, again, with giving that my attention. Crypto also, for now. There is never anything new. It's always the old.

I ended up playing Civ for most of the afternoon. Lolz.

New: Finished reading a short story, The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling by Ted Chiang, that's something?
