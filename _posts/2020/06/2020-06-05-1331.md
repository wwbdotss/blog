The approach to the weekend feels less exciting, and the approach is the best part. I'm dragging myself through the humps of weekdays like a sack of potatoes.

Writing this in the morning again. I got less strict with the times I get out and into bed. It could be the beginning of the unraveling, but I don't think so. Easing the edges gives me a better chance to keep up with the habit, and that's most of the battle.

My morning routine is blank right now and I want to add things. Breakfast should factor into it. Oatmeal I guess. I don't like how this time coincides with dad's breakfast time though. I would have to wake up earlier to have the time completely to myself.

I don't enjoy the work happy hour with the particular group makeup. G just goes on and on, which is nice in an unfamiliar, non-intimate situation when you want someone to fill in the space, but I want to actually talk to people and he's getting in the way with filler. I can't engage in actual conversation. I just want to talk to A. You can't do that in a stupid group call. That sucks how you have to address everyone all at once instead of naturally separating into individual conversations in person.

I will lift weights today.

I did.

Watched Civ 6 stream, was really interested. Watched minecraft stream. I still managed to pull away at 11 and keep the sleeping schedule on track.

New: Ate new tortilla chip flavor?? Scrapping the bottom of the barrel here.
