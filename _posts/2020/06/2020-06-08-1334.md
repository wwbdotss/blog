Bad day because I told C I missed her and she deflected, like always. Dad's TV doesn't work and it's annoying to call tech support. Connectivity problems such so bad. I'm so glad the internet has been trouble free so far. Day was also bad because I kept feeling out of sort with work. Dad also brought up me not getting married again. Instantly a damper on the day. There was something else too I'm sure, but together it all rolled up.

I went to bed early so exhausted from the mental trauma. I get tilted off the smallest things. I'm not tough enough for the world.

I did take a walk, which was good. The walk itself wasn't really anything.
