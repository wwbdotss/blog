So it's June. Writing this in the morning. I pretty much slept 12 hours. Took today off so I've avoided the spike of panic I always get in the morning of a work day during the QA stand up call. It's an inconsequential call, so I don't know why I react to it like I do. It's probably because it's something I have to do after a weekend of not having to do anything. A sharp reminder that I'm not free.

Am I going to go out today? I want to. Get boba. Cross the park again. Have something be a little normal.
