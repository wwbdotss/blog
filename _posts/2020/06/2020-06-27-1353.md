No one knows what streamers are really like. They are even more phony than movie actors. At least for actors, they're upfront about pretending to be other people, and aren't trying to convince you the character they are portraying is their real selves. I can't explain and articulate clearly there. I'm losing my words.

I guess so much for OfflineTV. RIP.

The droewors came; pretty good.
