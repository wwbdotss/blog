I slept and woke up when I said I would. Now I have to do it again. I need to restrict my daily resolutions to one thing or I won't remember. I still have to do the new thing.

I feel stupid in meetings. It's annoying as fuck to talk to J.

I finished some work I had been procrastinating on and it felt good. I didn't know completely if it would work and then it worked and I felt smart and things were going my way.

I reached out to S and it's like always in that I don't know who I want to be or portray when I'm talking with her. This time I went for something more direct and opinionated to get away from the tepid small talk. It didn't go anywhere. No engagement whatsoever.

V messaged me and asked how SF was doing. And talked about her and her husband playing Minecraft. I'm glad I still have that sliver of a connection with her and that we still keep in touch, if barely.

Great chat with E where I talked about how I worked out of fear of hunger and homelessness, but I was so busy I skipped lunch today so work didn't even solve my hunger problem. Felt like old times.

C talked about her brother last night, and I switched to some other topic today because I didn't want to talk about family. Didn't go anywhere.

New: Watched some trailers. That sort of counts.
