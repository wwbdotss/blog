Writing this on the workout bench. I stayed up late and didn't sleep great. Woke up groggy and unrefreshed. I really, really like to listen to good conversations though; don't regret staying up to listen to the two streamers talk. It's magic to me, how easily and smoothly some people can talk to each other. It's all I want.

The smallest effort I put into improving my life feels great. It's never been about that. It's getting started. I threw away some boxes this morning. Awesome. Even not turning on the PC feels amazing.
