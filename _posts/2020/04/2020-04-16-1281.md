Went to bed at 8 p.m. to try to get some sleep before the launch. Lay there awake until past midnight, then jolting awake at 3 a.m. to the alarm. It was the worst. Nothing broke so at least that was good. Went back to bed at 6 to try again to get some sleep. There was still another fast deadline and I needed to get up for a regular day of work. It's bullshit. Got up at 9 something, didn't sleep. Maybe for an hour.
