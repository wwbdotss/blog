Streaming drama is crazy entertaining!!

At one point, I was watching three streams with each stream streaming and commenting on another stream. That was peak. Amazing.

I got hit really hard when I heard the recorded phone message, when the girl told her ex-boyfriend "...because I fucking miss you." It was a glimpse of a world and situation I feel I will never be part of. There is this depth there, like I'm staring over the edge into this vastness that makes my own experience so shallow and thin. I have so much more to experience and learn, and I have not come out of my shell whatsoever. I am still in an egg.
