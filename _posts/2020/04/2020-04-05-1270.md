Another nothing day. Watched Louis CK and David Blaine. Both were mediocre, especially David Blaine. Took a walk, that's something. Watched more Fed streams. So much time I'm letting pass by. This is not sustainable whatsoever. I'm going to face the consequences eventually. Soon.

I need to make more friends to do things with.

I'm so hungry. I didn't do anything on my to do list.

Same feelings of hate for tomorrow. Sunday feelings still intact even during quarantine. I want nothing more than to not work.

Crypto has gotten boring again. Nothing is happening. I'll come back for the halvening.
