Exercised. I felt pretty good about it. I'm doing 30 lbs dumbbells and they are too light, so I feel nice and super in control.

I keep wishing for things not to be what they are. I want to live alone again, so badly. I want to arrange furniture, and place things in their place. I want to be rich so I could not work, and spend my time exactly and precisely as I want. I want to stop feeling not in control.

Caught up with a lot of sliceofmatt Youtube videos. I am so glad they exist and I would be sad when he stops vlogging. Comfort videos.
