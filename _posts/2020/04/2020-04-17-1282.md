Saw B wearing a hat and I wore one too during stand up. There was an email about it that everyone forgot or didn't care about. I messaged her that no one else was wearing a hat, and she smiled and picked up her cheese hat too. I loved it. All the while the call was going on. Highlight of the week.

I was sleepy the entire day and quit at 3 p.m. I had enough. Then I got a text and got back on at 4. So bad. I went back to bed until dinner.

I bought too much popcorn. They're pretty good. In smaller bags. I feel really awake now. Friday nights.
