B asked me to go on a happy hour chat. Frantically looked for a beer or something to drink. Found an 8 year old can of PBR. Went with it. Opened it and it sprayed all over. It felt great talking to her. I felt the surge of sociability and urge to reach out to people. I still feel that now. It sucks that I can't maintain this feeling permanently. I bet it's how some people feel all the time. Incredible.

I want to reach out to A and talk with her.

Walked to Irving from Golden Gate Park. Cafe where I like the salad was closed. RIP. I got nauseous hungry a few blocks before, so had to veer off to Irving to see what's open. Sheng Kee wasn't. Another RIP. Settled for Walgreens. Got blue berry Odwalla, which was good. Goldfish and double chocolate Milano. I stuffed my face. Peasant Pie was closed too. Walked back empty handed, full stomach.
