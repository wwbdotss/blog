Not great day. Hate feeling mute during meetings. The worst way for me to contribute is oral group discussions, aka fucking meetings.

Didn't close boxes, so the lingering feeling persisted the entire day.

I'm sort of sick but not really? I don't know. I'm tired. Didn't sleep well yesterday because I drank regular black tea boba. Today hopefully will be better.

Spent it all at the cafe. Toward the end, I really needed to get out of there. I had to pee, but didn't want to use their bathroom again. And I wanted water. Both of those things I could have just done there, but I irrationally ran away for some reason. The portobello mushroom sandwich is hella salty, every time. I'm not going to get it again.

Dad hit his head and there's a gash there and a bruise on his nose. Things like that are going to keep happening. There is no safety and I can't rest easy.

I need to cut my nails. It's so easy to fall in love with LilyPichu.

I'm not going into the office tomorrow again. I'm going to work from the West Portal cafe a little bit, then get a salad I guess, then the library. I don't feel good. And I'm taking liberties.
