Good to talk with A and B. I was worried about A. She wasn't in the office and no one knew where she was. Then she replied and I was really relieved. Got her boba. Walked with B, but T was there, so I didn't feel as special.

The nothing train continues. This is ridiculous. I don't know when I'm going to move on to something new.

BTC is above 9000 again, so that made me happy for a second.
