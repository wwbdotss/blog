Felt pretty good. I'm at the point where I'm so deeply rutted in my weekend routine, which used to be a last resort coping mechanism to get out of the house--and still is--that it's now comfortable. Wake up at 11 or so, take an hour to open my eyes and prop myself up, scroll around on Twitter and Reddit until I get uncomfortable from the sitting position in bed, walk to the mall, listen to podcast along the way, get matcha and random food court food, more Reddit while I eat, podcast on walk back. Afternoon killed.

I have to work so I can't do the same thing tomorrow, but I totally would. I would change it up by walking and listening to Shardcast, specifically. It'll happen, depending on how soon I finish work.

I did go to Trader Joe's to get some snacks, which I really need after dinner. Their apple cider vinegar cucumber mint flavor is amazing. They've managed to take the edge off the trailing end of the sip. It's my drink of choice there now for sure.
