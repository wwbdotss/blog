Starting listening to World War Z on audiobook. It's good. Every interviewee is a man so far. No women perspectives and it's Part 4. The author also makes a weak case for zombies being able to overrun a modern army. Not believable. The vignettes themselves are nuanced and layered, so I appreciate that.

I listened and walked my loop to avoid being at home. I took a nap afterward. I'm still in my hole. No improvement.

What are the steps I need to take? Where do I want to end up?

I want to end up in my own place, condo?, with a girlfriend, writing and self-publishing for a living.

How do I get there?

Write. Create that version of myself first. Meet new people and ask girls out. Save up enough money somehow to buy a condo. Or house. I have no idea how I would move out unless I get rich enough to buy a house.

Writing takes time. To free up time, I need to stop watching streams and youtube and reddit. I can't completely cut these off. I wouldn't want to. Maybe cut off reddit, that always feels terrible. I need to limit how much time I spend watching videos and streams.

I don't know. I don't really know what I want, and I don't have enough motivation to go after what I want.

This is a bad time.

I'm also having hemmoroids I think.

And I'm still walking around aimlessly. My weekends are deserts and wandering.
