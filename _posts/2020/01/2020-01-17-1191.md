The PC is too loud. I turn it off now to get some peace. Especially late night after showering.

Three-day weekend. I have no plans again. I will probably walk a lot. I'm so bored. I have nothing going on.

Work was fine. Nothing scary happening.

Ate at new place at the mall. It was weird. You get a big bowl and fill it with hot pot ingredients. You pay per pound. Then you hand over your bowl for them to make it into a soup or a sauce dish.

I don't feel as great talking to B as I did before. I guess that's it.
