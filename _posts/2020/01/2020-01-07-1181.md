I might be getting sick. Cold ass day. I didn't go into the office. Worked from home a little then at the library. Walked to Kevin's Noodle House. I really wanted pho for some reason, something substantial. Large number 2. Spring rolls, which I didn't finish. Boba, which is going to keep me awake tonight.

E started a new job this week.

I'm going to bed early and decide what I'm going to do tomorrow. I don't want to commute. Ideally, I would work all day out of the local cafe. Maybe I should at least walk to the West Portal one. I've been avoiding T1 and T2 lately. I don't want to see trash and homeless people all the time.

My subreddits are ethtrader, ethfinance, bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and offlinetv.
