Winter break over. Towards the end, the rate time passed kind of leveled out. Me working for several hours made anchored today down a little. It definitely made going back to work tomorrow easier. I'm not going down to Sunnyvale. Fuck that.

I have a burrito in the fridge I want to eat.

Been watching more streams, of Lily especially. I'm definitely really into her channel like I was earlier with Kate. Or with Youtube channels that I get deep into, wear them out, and cast away the husk. Ben Brown's channel. Fun for Louie. Rachel and Jun. Gone with the Wynns. Casey Neistat. I don't care about them as much anymore, when before I would want to watch every video. I still like Slice of Matt.

Should I buy more crypto? I would if I didn't put in so much already. That number scares the fuck out of me. I have no business throwing that much money away. It would be really important for me to get that initial investment back before I would trust putting more money in. I think that's a good decision. It minimizes regret. If everything skyrockets, I would not feel too bad because I already have so much in, and I could be rational about it.
