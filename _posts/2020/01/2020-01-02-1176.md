Spent day at T1, with just the CEO and G. There was trash and shit and someone sleeping outside T2. Fuck that, I'm not going to deal with that.

Didn't work, browsed the internet. Then left early when CEO left. Watched streams when I came back home.

I cut my hair and used the umbrella cape. It was bad. Hair was everywhere. I won't use that again. I'm totally just going to pay money to get my hair cut. Totally not worth it to do it myself.

Have to get up early to go down to Sunnyvale tomorrow. It's going to feel so bad.
