Talked with B during lunch, about nothing. There was nowhere to sit to eat so I brought it back up. I was going to eat and work at my desk. B asked me to sit with her, which is nice.

Talked with A too. At first, before lunch, then later, when she showed me more pictures of the big well along the coast. She wanted to use my phone to activate a SIM card for her friend? She'll be gone for a while to Dubai.

Took the late bus home because of stupid timing. Home, watched streams.
