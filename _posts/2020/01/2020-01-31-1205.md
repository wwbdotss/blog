Things are just getting worse and worse. My quality of life has done nothing but gone down. This is shit.

Work has never been more stressful. No satisfaction at all. Any inkling of accomplishment is uneasy because there are always some disaster waiting to spring up. It's pointless to feel good. It's only been a setup every time recently. I haven't felt good at work for so long. I hate working with J. Can't stand him. I can't rely on my boss to make things better for me.

Family is at a local minimum. First aunt being gone, and probably be gone for at least a couple of months, means dad just yelling at grandma every day.

I have no social life. I hardly talk to people. Seeing friends is sporadic. I don't do anything on the weekends but walk and wandering aimlessly.

I haven't written anything, or learned anything in years. I waste time watching streams and Youtube, and it's all I can do after dealing with work and family.

I'm fucking stuck and I don't know how to get out of it.

Seeing S on Sunday. I won't enjoy it, like last time.

Applied for a job. Quitting has so far been my only attempt at change and control in my life.
