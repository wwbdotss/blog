Irritated most of the day because I don't like doing anything I don't want to do. The things I didn't want to do today were normal good social things. Visiting second aunt and uncle for new years, and having dinner with them, then driving dad and V home. I mean, what the fuck is wrong with me that those things bothered me so much.

Tomorrow have to commute. Sucks and I hate it, as usual.
