Work is a distraction. I can't focus on what I need to do to break out of my current rut.

Didn't want to go into the office today. The choice is so easy to make at 8 in the morning. Sleep in for another hour and a half, or get up and go to the Tenderloin dodging shit and homeless people.

It's harder and harder to care about work, but I still have to do it, so that makes it more and more miserable. I feel really stuck.

Tomorrow. At least I'll get to talk to people. B and A. I need to make the most of it and build relationships.
