It's only 11:30. Tonight felt super long. I don't know why that is. I was watching streams like usual. TheRealGuyJudge gifted me a sub, which was very nice. I haven't been in his chat for months.

Walked a square up to the park, inner Irving, then back. Got soy boba at Eggette place, then tomato and clam, and chicken pot pie peasant pies, then salad soup combo with tea at crepe place, and finally a juice shot at Andronicos.

Watched the Niner game. It was fun because they won.

Still have kind of sore throat and phelgm.
