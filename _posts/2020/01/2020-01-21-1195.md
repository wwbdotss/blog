Dinner with E at ramen place. It was good, better than the stupid Chronicle review said. I wanted to drink all the soup afterward. Sparkling ume drink is also good. I was still hungry afterward. Got Super Duper. Can't wait to eat it.

Talked about E's new job. Lack of leadership there. Pepsi's CEO's kid is the COO, which is funny.

Spent all day at cafe not working. I'm caring less and less, but still anxious about getting fired.

LilyPichu's beach stream was good.
