Sundays will always suck. Dad worked, so I watched grandma all day. I also worked all day. Just terrible. I really wanted to go outside.

Food insecure. I just have insubstantial unsatisfying Trader Joe's almonds and blueberries. I was so hungry during dinner.

Reddit makes me angry. I need to really not engage or reply to anybody.

Today sucks too because I have to go down to Sunnyvale tomorrow. The work desert starts. The sands stretch on for I don't know when. As I was working today, every minute felt so pointless and stupid. Why was I doing any of this.

At least it's still kind of early, not 11 yet. I will at least get into bed early even if I couldn't fall asleep.
