OK day at work. Glad tomorrow I don't have to commute. Going to sleep in for the 9:30 call for sure. Would I still try to go to T2? The mornings around West Portal are great. It's the afternoon part that really sucks. I have nowhere to go except the library.

Ate burrito I got yesterday. It was good. Shredded chicken with sour cream. El bronco. I should ask for guac too.

B is going to a show and dinner with R, and of course I'm instantly and insanely jealous. I can't help it. When I look at it objectively, everything is fine. I don't have a lot of experience with very friendly girls and had a crush. There was never really anything real there. I don't think I even really like her romantically or feel strongly attracted to her as a potential partner. Not like when I compare how I feel toward A. I could see a future there, as slim as it might be. I don't have a good grasp on B. She charms me. I don't know her. I have settled finally into a good kind of equilibrium, I think. I can stop doing extra things around her. I could relax. There is nothing to lose anymore, and no objective, or potential to explore or feel out. Things are clear. Clearer, at least.
