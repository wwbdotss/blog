Zero day. I walked to the Indian pizza place to get the samosas that I liked so much last time. They were just OK this time. The papadum was oily and the only time I didn't like them. The tea was good. Then I walked through the park to the Blue Danube, which was packed, left for another cafe on 8th, which was packed, and ended up at my third choice. The omlette was meh. Ice tea was good. Got a lychee ice cream crepe with kiwi at Genki. Then I walked through the park again, caught the 29 at 19th just to go a few blocks to Sunset, which I felt better about walking down. I was sure as hell wasn't going to take the bus down 19th. I probably could have just stayed in the park and walked that distance and just made the entire trip on foot, which would have been interesting. I wanted to do something new today. Did I? I guess the omlette.
