Walked to the mall. The new thing I did was to add jelly to my matcha. It was pretty good. I got more soup at the new place. Got a lot of noodles this time, too much. Got the pickled vegetables soup. A lot of wintermelon. Marinated meat. Really good. I watched Lily stream and took time to eat, and it was really good.

Dinner at Jumbo with aunt, dad, grandma, and V. Meal was good.

More streams after. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time.
