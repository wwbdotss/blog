Slightly sick but not really. Stayed home. Bought Zicam because B suggested it and I read something about zinc. Then read the fine print. Homeopathic. Fucking trash. Threw it away.

Don't know what to do. This is in general.

Texted as many people as I could about Hamilton. It was a weird impulse. I didn't know what to do, so I wanted to check things off my to do list. The easiest things were on the to buy list. I bought some random stuff. Tresemme shampoo. That black bottle attracts me. Shampoo pump. Never going to go back to turning the whole bottle over and manually squeezing/waiting for shampoo to come out ever again. Toner. Then for some reason I thought about Hamilton and asked everybody. It felt like times before in my twenties when I invited people to do things. Don't remember the order... S first, then C? Then K, E, C, G and R, E. These are the people I text to do things with. I feel pretty good about that, that I still have friends I want to do things with.

I just bought some sheets. Partially to use my other credit card I haven't used for a while. And also, my gray duvet cover is gross. It has that shiny slick glossy feel pinstriped with regular cotton. Going to try percale. I want that hotel sheet feeling. It makes so much difference. My sheets are fine? If I like the duvet cover a lot, I'll replace my sheets with percale too.
