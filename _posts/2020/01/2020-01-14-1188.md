Today wasn't that great. No real nice moment to look fondly back at. Just frenetic rushed work because of bad planning as always. It's stupid.

B asked me to get lunch. I asked A. Got a salad finally. We talked about social media accounts. B told me that she went to Death Valley last weekend. I'm impressed by the places she goes to.

Bought random things at Trader Joe's. More apple cider vinegar. Ate at Marugame. Felt kind of sick for a little bit. Farted. Then felt better. Got matcha and crepe cake. Walked home. Watched streams.

It's 11:30 and I should go to sleep. Have to commute again tomorrow.

Crypto went up today, so that was good.
