Boba kept me up really late last night. Ugh. The number one pain I am feeling now is from allergies. I have this pressure headache thing going on and I feel dry and at unease. Spring fucking sucks. I fucking hate it.

I'm going to get soup tomorrow from the sandwich shop. I should go to restaurants, or the mall for a while.

The virus is so interesting.
