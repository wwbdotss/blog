Longest day ever. I did three loads of laundry. Washed sheets, duvet, duvet covers, pillow, pillow case, rotated bed.

S texted me and said she would be alone on her birthday. I really wish I could be with her then.

Ordered $50 from salad place. It was bad salad. I've more often than not been disappointed with Grubhub and delivery services in general.
