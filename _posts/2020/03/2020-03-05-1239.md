I'm full of disappointment with life not going my way. I don't know why that suddenly came to the forefront; it's nothing new. It's primarily C cancelling on things. I was really looking forward to seeing people and going out. If I don't do anything for camping, also, it's not going to happen either. I'm tired and just want things to fall to my lap. I don't want to talk to C for a while; her texts are so pointless to me now. I respond just enough to make it seem like I'm listening, but there's nothing more I want than just ignore her for a while. I'm deceiful and can't feel honestly. I mean, what the hell am I doing. If I like her, ask her out. If I don't, stop hoping. This middle area is bullshit. I'm wasting so much time and energy. I'm in a really lousy mood where people look their worst to me. It's annoying because I'll likely regret feeling all this, which is stupid. I can't even feel in a straightforward manner.

Took tomorrow off in anticipation of an eventful weekend. It's just going to be the same boring ass nothing weekends. I tried and failed and I don't want to get back on the horse and I don't want to try again. It's comfortable in the mud.

I'll walk and listen to podcasts tomorrow. My two favorite things apparently. I can do those things for a long time. I'll walk for a while.

I'm going to die like this.
