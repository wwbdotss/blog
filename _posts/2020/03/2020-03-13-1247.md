I went on a messaging spree. I got into a mood yearning for interaction. S texted me, which was nice, but I still don't know why she keeps staying in contact. I messaged C, E, R, G, and K. My core group it looks like. They are the ones I feel comfortable randomly messaging. Out of nowhere.

I hesitated but went by the mall. I wanted to see what Trader Joe's was like. Wasn't too bad. Some empty shelves and longer lines than usual, but no chaos or shoving. Got an apple vinegar. Then some Chipotle.

I am the most nervous about work than I have ever been. We're going to get sacked next week. I can feel it. Mandatory all-hands meetings.

My call with a recruiter is on Tuesday. I can't imagine it going anywhere, especially now with layoffs everywhere.

Crypto just got more boring because I'm sure it bounced back up along with stocks. ETH hovering between 100 and 200 for several months is boring as fuck. I want to peek at the end of the month also partially to set an alert for $50. I *will* load up when it hits. I will save for it. I should open that Fidelity or Schwab. Leaning toward Schwab.
