Phone interview was such a performance. I give myself props. I can't do the job; it was very obvious to me. I will need to sustain a near-peak level of motivation and sociability to do it. I just need a way to extract myself from this. I can't keep wasting time doing these essentially mock interviews. I should put in effort to do a better job where I am. I'm in such a lucky position and fit and I'm not going to let myself squander it.

B called me, missed it, called her, didn't pick up, she called me again, missed it again, and finally I called her back and connected. She was on her walk and just wanted to chat. Feels good.

Bought toilet paper on Amazon. Delivers in two months.
