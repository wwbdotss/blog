Spent day working out of cafe again. Once I step in, I should know I won't step out to go into the office.

I'll try harder tomorrow to get up earlier.

Bonus came in and I did some accounting. Accounting feels nice. I'm making numbers go up, and it feels more and more meaningless, in this trough between now and when I can retire. There is no difference at all until I reach my retirement number. Anything less than that is all the same, and cannot improve my life. $500,000 is not enough. $1 million is not enough. $1.5 million is not enough. All that might as well be nothing. Minimum $2 million. Aiming for $2.5 million. Would only start feeling comfortable at $3. $4 great. $5 ideal.

Crypto is the only thing that can get me there, so that really says a lot about my chances through normal means. I would be lucky to break $1 million with a regular job and savings.
