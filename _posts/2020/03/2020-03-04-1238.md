Watched more Outsider. The episodes are getting worse. Seeing it through to the end and hoping for a good finale.

Not feeling great now, for no real reason. The general vague downtrend of work, and family, and friends. C cancelled on both dinner and lunch, so this really social weekend just ended up being nothing. Sucks. She's so afraid of the coronavirus.

Need to plan out camping.
