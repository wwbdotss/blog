Didn't get up to go to the class because I didn't want to. Emailed instructor that I want to reschedule. Walked to Irving, got not very good grass jelly milk drink because I didn't want to get anything caffinated. I should just caffinated stuff; the other stuff is bland. Got salad again from Cafe Flores. Random work things trickling in annoying as fuck. All I want to do is not do anything for the rest of my vacation.
