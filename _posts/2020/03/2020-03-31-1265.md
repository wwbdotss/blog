Did accounting, and it wasn't super super bad. I want to see the bottom.

I'm really trapped now. Physically and metaphorically, more than ever before. I need to get away from dad and grandma. They just keep yelling. It's so bad. It's not going to end well at all, especially for dad. Grandma just resets and she's immune to time. Dad is going to carry the scars. I can't stand any of it and want to get away as far as I can. This is abusive household shit.

I'm going to actually use the backyard starting now. I'm going to avoid taking walks. I felt how much more I have to lose than gain today. I can work out in my room, and get sunshine and air in the backyard. Easy peasy. Have to make do without cardio.

Work should slow down now.
