Had to work. It's bullshit.

Got toilet paper! Success. V and I got up early to go to Walgreens. They restocked today. I got there before the truck did, so wandered around the area for a while. Got some Andytown coffee for the first time. Snowy Plover, soda coffee with whipped cream. It was pretty good; I'll get it again for sure.
