So great useless day. I wish every PTO day was like this. Carefree as fuck. Everything was easy and slow and no effort.

Woke up 10:30 something. Lunch at home. Moseyed around the room and I actually started unpacking. Went back to watching LilyPichu and Twitch. I lasted three weeks at least.

Left for a walk.
