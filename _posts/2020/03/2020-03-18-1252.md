Phone interview tomorrow. How much do I want the job.

Could one person make me leave my job? I'm actually weighing that. If J wasn't there, would I still want to leave? I'm not going to think about him anymore. I don't want to waste any more brain space. Fully to the disregard pile.

Dad seems OK. I spent a lot of time last night going through death scenarios of all my family members. Morbid as fuck.

Waking up early. I'm sick of the panic and raised heart rate every fucking time I wake up. Setting alarm to 8. I need some peace.

Walked to West Portal, got a breakfast burrito. Starbucks was still open. Six cops outside not social distancing.

A set up a virtual lunch with me, A, and M tomorrow, which is nice.
