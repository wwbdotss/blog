Finished Fall. I liked it. Looking forward to getting into another book. Reading more is a solid plan. Everything feels right about it.

Applied to another job. Deloitte this time. My main productive thing.

I'm glad I went out to see dad when he came back. His chat with first aunt while eating dinner is very domestic and that scene is going to be what I remember when I think family.

Scrolling through old movies on HBO Now depressed me for some reason. The thought of all the people in those movies in the past just made me sad. It's a contrast to cutting present of YouTube and especially Twitch, where it's as current as it gets. It's the same feeling I get when I looked back at past journal entries or old calendars. I do not like thinking about the past it seems. The bad memories crowd out the good, and the good just remind me of what I lost. I dwell in the future for sure, and daydream and fantasize about being rich and free and in love.

Looking forward to getting the bonus from work tomorrow. Oza Oza with C. Day off on Friday.
