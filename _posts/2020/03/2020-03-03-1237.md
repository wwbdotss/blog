Watching the Outsider. Mystery is good. I don't like the horror. Especially with little kids. Can't stand it.

Watching TV shows and movies makes me feel better about myself than streams. I feel like I wasted my time after watching hours of a stream. Finishing a show or movie makes me think.

Tent in front of T2 today. This is just getting stupid, living in the city. T1 wasn't even open. The metal gate was there.

I left the cafe early and ate $40 worth of sushi for a late lunch at Japantown. Iced matcha with jelly and no sugar. Frozen yogurt, original tart and mango.

I had so much time. The bus passed the hospital and I made up my mind to get off and finally pick up my prescription. I didn't think to use my FSA; I didn't my card anyway, but still. I need to go through some hoops to get the $15 lousy dollars reimbursed.

I don't know what I'll do for my day off, and my week off later this month.
