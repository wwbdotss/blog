Thought to suggest to dad we get take-out for lunch. Felt great because it made it easier for him and he wouldn't have to cook.

Once again, the food I get from Grubhub disappointed. I don't know why I never manage to get good food. Next time.

Walked up to Irving, going around to see what was open. Sheng Kee was, but they didn't have their banh mi. So kept walking inbound. Maybe Peasant Pie was still open (it wasn't). On the way, saw that Cafe Flores was. They had a nice salad menu. Cajun chicken salad. Yes please! It was really good. Reminded me of the spicy chicken salad from California Fresh, so long ago. I've found my salad for now for sure.

I want to buy more crypto. I'm getting more and more desperate and see it as my only lifeline. I cannot keep working for the next 30 years. Increasingly, the stock market is a joke to me. Slow as fuck, and I don't believe in how fucking fragile the thing is. The network is not a support web but a chain that drags down everything connected to it. Crypto is clean.

I can take the biggest risk of my life so far. Roughly one year's expenses. It's a nice and proper emergency fund. Does its job, especially now when I don't want to work and have never felt so disdainful of work. Glad to have it. But. Double-digit ETH is near. I am *so* tempted. This pandemic is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. If I want it, this is the only time I would be able to get it. I'm absolutely certain of that.
