Finished the king and cupcake story and I feel great about it.

Slept a lot last night, because I took today off. Went to bed at 11 something and got up at 11 something. It felt substantial, like I really needed it. Which I did.

V cancelled her cruise and is sad because of it. I'm relieved, but also know how sucky the situation is.

I walked to Hard Knox and got the chicken pot pie. It was ok. KFC is better. I should have gotten the étouffeé instead like I wanted. The corn bread is still amazing.

Then Blue Danube. I walked home after. Got a banh mi on Irving. Walking and podcasts.

I asked V and V to read my story. It was great to have something to show people.

Watching the Abyss. The Outsider's finale is on Sunday.
