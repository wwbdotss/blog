Felt good because a coworker said J makes her nervous sometimes. I'm petty.

I'm most worried about first aunt and dad having to go out to buy groceries. Delivery is totally swamped, I imagine, but haven't checked. I need to help them with this. And finding toilet paper.

I will take a long ass walk tomorrow.
