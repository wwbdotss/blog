My ETH alert went off. Unbelievable. It's all I can think about now. I can double my ETH. I want to so badly. It would bring the number I need so much closer to reality. 2x ATH. Oh my god.

This is too much risk, even for me. I would literally have no cash if I do this. The one thing that really scares me about the economy is me losing my job. I don't care about the market numbers. If I were to do this, I would be taking the biggest risk of my life. I could actually cause real, material damage to myself. The downside instantly swells into a giant ass hole. The upside...it would stay require years for crypto to recover. At least. 2x is not a given at all. Even 1x would seem far-fetched at this point.

I will look at the charts after all at the end of the month. I want to see the carnage starkly. It's really interesting times and I like reading about people's reactions. Crypto must be so buzzing right now. It's despair beyond the usual. I also want to see how things settle in two weeks. If it's still two-digit ETH, then I can fantasize some more.

Went to Lou's to get some soup and a sandwich. The clam chowder is fine. Kind of too sweet. I also got some mango boba. Patronizing local business.

Virus going nuts. Market going nuts. I'm on the edge of my seat.
