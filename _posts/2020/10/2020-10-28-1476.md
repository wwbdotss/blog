Ate second chicken and rice takeout. Not as great as the one fresh from yesterday, but still ok. Drank last kombucha. Not going to save them anymore for later. C texts, which I'm dutifully answering. Still doing minimal work, or as much minimal work as I could risk. Stayed up watching more travel vlogs. Nobody likes Chinese tourists. Well, people like their money I guess.
