Wracked with stress and anxiety about work. Went to bed at 8 something exhausted, didn't sleep until after 1 probably, and kept waking up intermittently from being so wired, heard everything in the house. I woke up naturally before my 5:30 a.m. alarm, I was that strung. One of the worst night of sleep ever.
