Another bad day. Everyone's annoying me. I feel isolated and alone and unable to communicate. Crypto went up, but fucking YFI didn't. I'm so sick of it. It managed to drag down what would otherwise be a great crypto day. It's going to be my biggest regret, I can feel it. I haven't had it long enough to know this for sure yet, and I haven't given up on it, but it is absolutely shitting the bed. I don't want to look at it. I do like watching the vault rewards for it though. It doesn't show price, and only delicious cumulative percentage gains. I'll focus on that. The graph can't go down. About to hit 0.01 earnings soon. Nice.
