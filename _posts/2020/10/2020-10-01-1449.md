I've never wanted to buy so hard. It's like, my body reflexively tingles in anticipation. Everything feels right. How can I resist?

I'm a bad person because I also involuntarily had a dumb grin on my face when I heard Trump got covid. I should never wish ill on someone, etc. This is too funny.

Felt good because passed TT, and the meeting I didn't want to go to got moved. Also, moon festival is good. Food, and having family. Really grateful.
