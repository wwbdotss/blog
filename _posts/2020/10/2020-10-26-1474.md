Moved the last of the YFI. There's a note of finality to it. I'm going to leave crypto alone until at least end of the year. Try, at least. Not going to fully engage. I also don't want to buy any more. I kind of do, but I'll refrain. I am cash poor.

Watching Kara and Nate's vlog backlog is so satisfying. I feel very settled in and don't want it to end.

I felt so nervous about work, and insecure and scared.
