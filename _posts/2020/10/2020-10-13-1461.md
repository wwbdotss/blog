Worked from 6 a.m. til 9 p.m. It's stupid. Things weren't as bad as I thought, and I caught good breaks, got time when I needed it. Felt really happy when C texted and wanted to talk to her about things. Checked crypto and it was pointless. Didn't eat well at all, had random bits of food throughout the day, sloshed in soylent. And it's not over.

Sleep sleep.
