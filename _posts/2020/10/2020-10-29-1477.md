So many parts of work that I don't like. So many dreadable parts. Scrumptious. I got more chicken and rice, and I think I've had enough, at least for now. It's too expensive, and actually not that great. It's just chicken and rice.

The walk to the mall is still good. Still has that critical purpose and food piece in the middle, that the S route sorely lacks.

Writing still is my only hope, and it's really funny that I don't do it. It's in perpetual fantasy and only exists as a sustaining and effusive dream that spews wishful thinking, bottomless. It's self-renewing too, and the longest lasting thing in my life. I will never not daydream about being a writer. It even overshadows my depression, pessimism, and nihilism. Those sort of fade in and out a little, and it takes some slight effort to sustain. But not this writing thing. It's amazing in that sense. Where does the energy come from? How can it keep my jumpy attention so well?

What next. I can't last much longer at my job. I didn't feel like this until the past year or so. I felt great and settled and secure. Now it's nothing but crumbling ground at every step that I thought was solid and built-up from before. Apple sucks. I can't relax this weekend. It's lost because of three meetings Friday, then Monday and Tuesday. I just need to look for another job, what am I doing.

I just applied to a job, that felt pretty nice.
