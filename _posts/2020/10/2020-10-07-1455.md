I'm probably burned out. Reading about coastFI, and thinking more about quitting and taking a lower stress job. I don't want to save anymore. Today was distribution day, at least. One of them. The other, not so much. I'm refreshing the page.

I've also accepted that I have to say there's not enough time for me to do the work. Nothing I can do. Should have scheduled and told me the deadline and expectations earlier. Bad communication. Company will lose that account for sure, especially now that the original manager is gone.

I feel better all of a sudden.

Talked to H for an hour on the phone. I texted both her and C at the same time, and C hadn't replied. I was also a little hesitant to text C because I knew she wouldn't have a supportive reply to my whining. Hm.
