I'm clutching to crypto.

C texted me some more, initiating texts. I answer. I feel automatic. I'm not being a very good friend. I'm not actively cultivating or nurturing my relationships. I'm going to watch them wilt if this continues.

I still can't do what I want. I want to buy a condo and stop working. I can't see that happening with anything but crypto. Stocks can't get me there. My job can't get me there. It's why I'm clutching so hard, and thinking about it all the time. Can't think about anything else.

If I really wanted, I could go after what I want right now. That's plenty of money. I'm making excuses.
