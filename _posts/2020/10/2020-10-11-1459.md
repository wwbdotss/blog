Updated website, that was good. I didn't check crypto today, that was really good.

Things keep getting worse. Things that occupy my attention keep getting worse. I thought my butt was healed, but it wasn't. I guess I really do have cancer. I hate that I checked it off my list, and now have to add it back. I need to talk to a doctor. Dad could also still have covid. I'm just waiting around for bad things to happen because I don't do anything proactive to improve my situation.
