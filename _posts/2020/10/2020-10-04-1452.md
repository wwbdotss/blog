Don't want to sleep yet. Only thing I'm looking forward to is token distributions. Crypto's down. I subscribed to dozens of Youtube channels for escapism and fantasy. Travel, house builds, homesteads. Watching an Idaho family start with the land and building everything up is very interesting. Real life Stardew Valley. It's also interesting because their way of life is so different from mine. The same Sunday night dread for work tomorrow. How much longer can I endure this. I still have no idea what I want to do, or go from here. I'm drifting. I've been drifting.
