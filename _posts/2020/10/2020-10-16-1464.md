Worst day of work, because I'm getting a paycut. Of course it would happen after all the work I just did. Next year will be the first time my salary would be lower than the year before. This is objectively another peak I've crested. Fuck this. I have nothing left. The only thing I had. Everything is plainly sloping down. This is defeat.

I don't know.

I took a walk. It was the best walk. S route. Music. Drank some watermelon coconut juice.

I feel really great right now. This feels like a normal Friday night again. There are no pressing deadlines for work. I've done the work already and banked some successful projects. I have cup noodles and kombucha. Tomorrow dad won't be home so I don't feel as enclosed. A good time to order food. I was bingeing travel videos at first. It's really good, all things considered. I feel physically good. Ready to sleep in.
