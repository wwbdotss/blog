C hella annoyed me by being rude. I sent her a link about AOC on Twitch and she replied "Why would I care about this?" Wtf. I told her she was rude, and it's times like this that I can't imagine being with her. She is not someone I want to live with or be around all the time. I think I can say this even when I'm not annoyed right now.

Crypto spiking. I need it to go higher so it'll settle higher.

Minimal work today, just the way I like it.

She apologized, that was pretty cool. I don't know if I accepted the apology well though.
