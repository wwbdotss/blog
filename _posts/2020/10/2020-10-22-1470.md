Change is bad only when change happens to me. If I caused the change, then change is very, very good. Took a walk, my body feels it. Really needed it too. Crypto is up. YFI is still sucking. I can't get over it.

Depressed as ever. M is moving on to other projects, so it means I won't get to work with her. Little things like that really sinks my mood. I get very attached, apparently.
