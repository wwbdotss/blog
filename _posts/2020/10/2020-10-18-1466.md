Slept in some more. It takes me hella long to recover. That work week sucked so bad. Walked around, wanting a burger. Got a mediocre one at a local place. So not worth it, never going there again. I should have gone for a fast food burger, and it wouldn't have cost me $5. Got boba and popcorn chicken, but the chili powder shaker wasn't working well and I couldn't see properly because of fogged up glasses so couldn't tell that no seasoning had come out. The chicken tasted plain and I threw away half of it, with the mediocre boba as well. I think I'm pretty tired of 25% sweetness jasmine milk tea. I need to go with HK milk tea all the time, full sweetness, and just enjoy. Home, watched travel vlogs. Still watching them. Crypto has just been a constant disappointment this entire time. I'm depressed. Sleep soon. I'll do the minimum at work next week. I don't care even less now after the pay cut. There's no point.
