Felt better today. Walked to the mall to get some chicken and rice. Then got some strawberry milk tea. Sat outside of Chipotle, and ate. It was so good. I haven't felt so nice on a walk for a long time, ever since things closed down. Having a place to sit down and eat matters a lot. I really liked eating outside on a warm evening. Perfect.

Texted with C and IMed E, so those were huge contributors to my feeling of well-being.

It felt great to walk and sweat. I felt active, and working my body. I felt healthy and physical. The walk was purposeful in that way. I'm totally doing this for every walk. Too bad S route, no more of that. I'm going to single-handedly keep Rooster and Rice in business at that location lol.

Work was also nothing today. Minimal. That was also great. Dad wasn't home either, so no stress there.

It's as much as I could ask for, for a day.

Didn't check crypto prices, but did check Twitter. Eh.

What can I expect from tomorrow. I'm going to avoid the dev meeting, which would make me feel good. I would have to work, so not as good. Nothing dreadful. Me slacking off now will come back to haunt me, of course.

More travel vlogs now.

I'm really self-conscious about the spot in the very middle tip of my nose from a pimple that left a mark. Fuck.
