I could understand Bitcoin maxis more. I'm sick of trusting people. Robots and code all the way. Walked today, got an ice cream cone, wanted to get nachos from 711 again, but again didn't want to get corona for nachos, and got a burrito instead. The burrito's never been satisfying.

Listening to Counting Crows now.
