It really is getting worse. I woke up in a panic in the middle of night, anxious as hell, everything on high alert because I hear little sounds from dad's room. I cannot stand it. I got the noise cancelling headphones on top of the ear plugs. It was so bad. I've already gone through the time he called out for help and I have pretty much been waiting for it to happen inevitably again. So much I cannot evade, come barreling toward me from the future. I can see the headlights. Fuck. This is going to happen again tonight and forever and I can't escape. I need to move out of here.

Signed back up for Netflix and it doesn't help at all. Watched Snowpiercer. It's like they try to come up with the most upsetting, nastiest things and hide those as big reveals. The whole movie is gross.

Watched Russian Doll, and I cannot relate to any of these people. Next.

I finished the ether book. OK documentary style of the history. The only parts I cared about were people's reactions to the price.
