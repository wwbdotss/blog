I cleaned and tidied today. Stored away the PC and monitor. Returned the weak router. Amazon has free boxless, labelless returns at UPS; how can anyone else compete? Got boba there and walked a little. Couldn't get all the way to the park yet. I really like having a plant on my desk.

I drew some plans for a low shelf. Complete plans, actually. It's going to be the same style of shelf I built before, only it'll be two and a half feet tall. I'm never going to move out apparently. I don't see it happening anymore. It was a nice fantasy and seemed possible a week or so ago.
