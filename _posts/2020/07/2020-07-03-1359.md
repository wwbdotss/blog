Another angry episode. First aunt pressured me to engage more with L. I do not have control over my emotions whatsoever. Especially anger. I don't know how to deal with it. Suppression, of course, only creates more pressure.

I played Civ and had trouble sleeping. Now that the SF office is closed completely, I have an opening to move out on the guise of concern for the commute. Could be something.
