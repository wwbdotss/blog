Stayed up til 2 a.m. working. Stupidity and failure to reject unreason.

Still texting with L. I linked her Your Hand in Mine, and it's the first time in the history of the world that someone I sent a song to said they listened to it and liked it. It's amazing.

I woke up hella anxious the past couple of days. Just like in fucking panic. I could sort of explain it. Wonder about tomorrow when the obvious bad things are gone.
