Feel a little better about work today. Things aren't as bad as they seem. It seems more likely to me that I'll be fired by the end of this year than to still be there. Something bad is going to happen during the fall. I forecast this.

Texts with L continue. But for how long?? We're still talking about nothing. The rhythm has settled down a bit, so it doesn't feel like if a day goes by without any interaction that all's lost.

Walked to Lakeshore to print out the lotto claim form. Fogged up glasses, small bad touch pads that don't support my USB fob, and having to rent computers to print things out--I got some sushi and thai iced tea instead. The sushi was also bad. The tea was tea. I only drank half, and hoping it won't keep me up too late.

Worldbuilding still sounds really fun to me. Maps. Just describing how things are. This will be my hobby.
