Watched Dark. It's exactly like Stranger Things and The Outsider and I stopped watching after a few episodes. Formulaic. Scrolling through Netflix and seeing old movies make me feel hella sad. I don't know why. Brings me back a little bit to my lonely hotel trips where I scroll through Netflix. Perhaps. It's not a good time.
