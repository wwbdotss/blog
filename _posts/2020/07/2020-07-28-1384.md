Work irritates me so much, especially working with J and A. It's both from feelings of inadequancy and jealousy. Simple, really.

I changed the name of the wifi and felt good seeing the random network copies disappear. No idea if anyone was stealing the wifi, but just the thought of them not being able to anymore feels hella good.
