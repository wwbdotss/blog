I'm going to divorce my feelings from work. It's pointless to feel at work. There is no basis.

Printed out the lotto claim form. Productive. Got boba. The walk was good. Exercised. Listened to Louis CK conversation with Blanche Gardin. The conversation was performance and afraid to be boring. It's interesting.

The back of my knee doesn't hurt anymore from walking, which is good.

I texted L about boba. Also texted A about boba.
