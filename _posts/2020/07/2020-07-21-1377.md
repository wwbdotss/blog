Felt good today to actively figure out why the internet was cutting out even when the modem is plugged into a UPS. There was another powered device where the fiber comes in. Mystery solved.

A great day today because I got to leave the house and worked from T2. I got to indulge one last time the office, and walked down the usual lunch route looking for whatever I felt like eating. It was amazing. I got enchiladas from a new place that took over the east coast diner space. It was super filling. I didn't finish. Also got boba and cookies from a new cookie place that took over the gelato space. I just hate being at home, living with dad and grandma and first aunt, there's no getting around it. It doesn't get any more definite and clearer that that's the source of a lot of my depression and anxiety and general discontent.

Stopped writing again after the little spurt of trying to outline and worldbuild. I'm never going to write. What a dream.
