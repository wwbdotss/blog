Feeling much worse about work. Everything sucks. I shouldn't have finished the one project so fast when it wasn't due for another week. Now I have no shield to slack off.

Told dad about lottery win. Feels better than not telling him.

Listless. Bored. Extremely unmotivated. Anxious. Depressed. Aimless.
