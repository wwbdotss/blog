Today was the worst anxiety when I woke up. It's work and family. The anxiety associated with work is sharp and hot. The family anxiety lingers and drifts and drags me under. I built the email in a day essentially. And lots of meetings where I need to perform. It's stagefright. For family, it's something that will never mend. I can't ever satsify what dad wants me to do and it's going to be like this forever. My only option is to move out. And then I'm destined to live in regret. Regret is inevitable. I can so feel it. I can't avoid it either. How do I repay dad for all he has done and given me if the only thing he wants is for me to get married? It's absolutely conditional and fucked up. It's in my mind gotten simple in that matter. My relationship with my father is a one-issue relationship. There is no happiness here.

I felt great after I went through the onscreen review. L actually texted me, which felt great great. I took a walk and there was immediate pain behind my knee. I'm crippled for life and even walking is taken away from me. The demise of all facets of my life continues. Weirdly, running doesn't seem to affect the same tendons or muscles or whatever is down there. That could symbolize something.

Going to sleep early. It's going to feel nice after all the exhausting anxiety this week.

I still haven't eaten my curry peasant pie or the half of the chicken banh mi V bought.
