I was laying out my websites in my head again and couldn't sleep for a while. I've been tired all day.

I couldn't work any more and took a walk. My legs are back to normal and feel fine again.

I got clam chowder and a reuben sandwich.

I finally looked up how to set https and after some unhelpful articles, found a random post that says to delete and re-create the CNAME file and I could check the Enable HTTPS box. I did and that was literally it. Clean feeling!

Crypto is still up and I spent all morning watching charts and youtube videos and subreddits. I still need 10x before I think about selling, which might be bad.
