Uneventful Sunday. Listened to Supernova in the East Part 4. Didn't text L. Watched Broken Bonds D&D stream, which was better than I thought. The first session has the energy. Installed Civ on the new work laptop. I should really uninstall it. The laptop has a crappy GPU and it doesn't feel good playing the game with the fan loud. Oza Oza emailed me about their take-out menu. I'm so ordering some bento boxes. Tried to style Atom; it's hard. I gave up.
