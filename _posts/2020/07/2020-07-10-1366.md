Everything's breaking. The UPS just died after I tried to move it down for the router. Dead electronics.

Mailed the lotto form, which is nice.

Bought a sandwich and got turkey chili and some yerba mate.

Looking forward to not waking up in a panic.

Tried to watch some LilyPichu stream and got annoyed.

Guy's stream of Timberborn was good though. There is definitely a place for smaller streamers.
