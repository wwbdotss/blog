Crypto up again. It's hard to remind myself this is meaningless until I get to my number, which would require all this movement except 50x. That puts a damper on things, but still, it's the best part of waking up the past few weeks to see the price.

I'm re-laying out my sites and it's just as fun as all the times before. I'm in the right mood.

Need to return the router today. Get some boba. Nice.
