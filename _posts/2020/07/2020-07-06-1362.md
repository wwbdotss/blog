Texted L with a follow up about her hike. The only thing I feel is insecurity. We can't meet up in person so I don't know what I'm supposed to do in the meantime. It doesn't seem to be going anywhere, and the smalltalk is not paving the way for anything.

The conversation sort of opened a little to covid then to family travels.

Hate work.
