Crypto went up so I feel good. It's simple.

I want to work for myself, that's been a durable truth. Working on something driven from within has felt so good every step of the way. I remember working on websites and felt that persistent power to go forward. That's what I need. I need to care.

Exercised and took a walk. I got a blueberry ice cream cone at Polly Ann's. It was nice. My leg didn't break down this time either. Listened to podcasts along the way.

I'll sleep now and fantasize about crypto.
