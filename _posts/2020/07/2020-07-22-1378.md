What can I do, maybe the only thing is to endure the pandemic and keep plodding. Every day is going to be like this. Week. Month. Year. Election. It does make me rethink delaying any gratification. I have some chili I want to eat. I first think that I should save it for the weekend or some resting point when I can enjoy it better, away from the work week. But then, no, the weekends aren't that much better. There's no point waiting thinking that somehow the wait would tenderize the reward and make it better. Now now now.

Taking a shower does help to cut off the mid-evening despair and reset me a little. I feel better than I did before, for sure. I'm even ready to watch a movie now, which I did not feel like at all minutes before. Streams have been disappointing lately. Why am I watching these people. I will get drawn back by loneliness soon enough.

Checked crypto and my brain lit up, headache gone, and I'm alert as hell reading posts. There was nothing physical or real *at all* before when I felt bad. What the fuck. How could interest make that much of a physical difference in how I feel? Is novelty and stimulation the only prerequisites for my happiness? Boredom really is the enemy?
