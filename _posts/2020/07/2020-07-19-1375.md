Even the numbering of the posts doesn't seem to be moving. 1375 sounds so familiar, like I've passed it before.

It's also a second wave for my mental degradation. The lockdown is never going to end. The major thing that makes me depressed is a hopeless future, where I can't imagine myself in a better position. That's happening right now, intensely. I have nothing to look forward to. The only things I see ahead of me is more of this. Stuck at home. Reliant on a job. No creativity. No progress anywhere. Decay of my already scant social life and relationships. Absolutely nothing for romance or finding a girlfriend or even meeting new people. I have the same old thoughts day in and out. It's just despair. Nothing I do makes a difference.

And repeat.
