Today just felt flat. Got through meetings and preflight and didn't do anything the rest of the day. Crypto fell just when I thought it would finally break 20k. Low expectations for tomorrow. Finally ate the queso cheese dip. Wasn't very good. I definitely prefer the unauthentic Tostito's version. Cut my finger trying to use a knife to get the avocado seed out. I knew it was going to happen too, cause I sliced my hand doing the same thing before. Never again. I'm having fund skimping Rhythm of War. I just want the secrets. I don't care about the characters or plot. Those are just trappings, carriers for juice.

My hurt rib is bothering me a lot. Hard to move around in bed, and every movement I make reminds me that something is wrong.
