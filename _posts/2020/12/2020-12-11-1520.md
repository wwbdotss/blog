Finished Serial. There is no ending.

I went to bed early 10:30 and woke up at 11 in the morning. Depression and despair are exhausting.

Talked to A and A for a lunch video chat. I wish I could express myself better. I need more practice. My conversation skills are so poor. I can't talk to anyone as I am. I keep performing.
