Don't like not talking during meals with dad but I have nothing to say. Crypto still on my mind. I want to figure out how much I'm actually investing. It's open-ended right now. Ally is now down to 0.50%. It's offensive. It really isn't any better than putting it under my mattress. I still get satisfaction and value out of knowing it's there nominally.

I want to buy more DOT. And YFI. and ETH. I only want coins that give me more coins.

DOT first. It's low. YFI and ETH are high. I'll prioritize DOT. ETH next for sure, even if it keeps rising. I want a staking stack ready. I want to be part of ETH 2.0 staking just to feel what it's like.

Before all of this, I'm going to be disciplined and fill up my emergency fund back first. I'll buy in March.
