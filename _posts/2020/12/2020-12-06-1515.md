The lockdown really hit me today. I hate how much nothing I'm doing. I'm lulled. I'm normally unmotivated as it is, but now I'm so unmotivated I'm have negative motivation. Crashed through the fucking floor on the scale. When I look back, it's a darker hole than usual in my memory, the past year, two years, when it's all done.

Crypto is the worst thing to have happened to me. It pretty much shredded my initiative. I will have nothing to show for all the time and attention I've spent. I'm birthing a tragedy.

I'm eating way too much junk food too, out of boredom. This is the worst kind of snacking. My rib is feeling better, at least. I should just run again, injury or no. That'll be something cumulative I would have to show afterward.
