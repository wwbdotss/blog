Worked late. Again, no one will know, and it might as well not have happened. It was nice interacting with a new developer from another group, and being able to work and understand each other on the same problem. Mind company.

Bought more groceries on Amazon, just needed $5 of instant mashed potatoes but spent more than $35 to get the free shipping. It's stupid.

My eyes are dry, especially in the morning from the dry air and glare.

Got another airdrop MIR because I got the UNI airdrop. Retro distributions are so interesting.
