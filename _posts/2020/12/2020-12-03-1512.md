Can I wait two more years for crypto?

I can't believe I believe this.

Five years. Ten years, more like it. If ever. I like to believe because it gets me excited to wake up in the mornings.

I'm mentally set to work only five more years, then I have to quit and do something else. I can't keep doing what I'm doing now. And giving myself five years is procrastinating. I need to be doing something to change my situation right now. Covid is also a convenient excuse.

I want to buy a car. That will be something tangible at least. And I do want a car. It'll be so nice to go places again. I feel I've exhausted the walkable area around me. It's become rote and not active walking any more.

I hope to keep above X at the end of the month. That would be pretty great.

I'll ask for PTO now. I want to slice up January and soften the entry back into the unbroken work desert plateau.
