Day 5. Does counting the days make the time pass by slower? I've given up trying to moderate my crypto obsession and addiction. It's all I think about. Though my new agenda setting process is diverting enough of my attention to writing that I'm progressing on the story. I think that contributes to me not holding back on crypto. It's an effective bribe.

I took another walk today. Got a carnitas burrito.

Didn't watch Tenet, again.

I need to devote some time to setting the agenda for the day. It's still ad hoc, as I go along, kind of thing now, and I haven't set any more goals than writing and a few other ones. I want to do more.
