Day 7. I'm still completely wired right now. A news site picked up the story. What the fuck.

I've broken all my rules I had on my list. I watched Twitch. I read my phone in bed. I looked at charts. No discipline.

The weather is nice and cloudy, damp. I'll go for a while to unwind.

I also have to sign a lot of refinance documents. It's the one thing snagging my mind.

Holy shit. I cannot deal with stress at all. My entire being seems to unravel, and I get this hollow feeling inside. I am not up to the task of dealing with adversity, at all. I'm shook. I needed to prove my claim and sign a message. I mad rushed around reading how to do that. It involves the private key, of course, and I didn't know what to do. I was risking all my money. It was not a good decision on my part to comply. It was the worst decision. I hated doing it. I had no resistance or self-esteem or any personal resolve. If someone tells me to do something I apparently just do it. Fuck. I'm so disappointed in myself.

Feeling very out of sorts right now. It's because of the jolt and stress from the verification. I know this feeling well. It passes. Right now though, I can't find comfort in the usual things, and I feel even more adrift than usual. Definitely avoid crypto for a while.
