Slow days at work. I read a little. Started again to listen to Serial on a walk. I finished the first episode, and not hooked yet. I'll try episode 2. Watched more youtube. E gave me Youtube Premium, which is nice. I don't see ads before, but I can turn off my screen on my phone when listening to Youtube videos at least. That's something. And Youtube Music. I finished the black bean quinoa Whole Foods chili and the rest of the hummus. That gave me a sense of completion, which is *something*. I asked about the Rocher chocolate in the cabinent and dad said it was a year old. It expired at May. We and V ate some anyway. Yeah, it was stale, not going to eat anymore. Too bad. E sent me a picture of $100/lb wagyu beef at Costco. My first reaction was actually I want to buy it. C texted me about if a house built in 1980 was old. I didn't know. I started the initial steps of a project, and it's the thing that I need to keep going. I can feel the procrastination seeping in already, but making that minimal effort to get started makes a lot of difference. I went to bed and didn't blog today, writing this the morning after.
