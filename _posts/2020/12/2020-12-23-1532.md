Break. Time will fly by.

I jotted down a sketch of a scene, so I'm glad of that. I just wrote without planning. I'll plan later, for sure, as I need to know where it goes, but it's fun in this first part to not worry about that.

I don't have as much money as I think I do. And I don't even think I have that much! I really am poor and there really are rich as fuck people other there. The average is higher than I expected, but shouldn't have been surprised.
