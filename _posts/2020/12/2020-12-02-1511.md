Still up, 12:25 a.m. I watched a stream to get details on the move, but there was nothing. Why am I watching these people? The distain on LSF was right.

The salsa from El Burrito Express is hot as hell. I wanted to buy some guacamole from them, but ended up buying enchiladas. I couldn't bring myself to ask them for a tub of guac.

Staying up also because I don't feel like any work is going to happen tomorrow, or this week. I'm peak sloth. Doing nothing but watching crypto charts.
