Day 8. Feel much better today. I needed closure. I got it from reading all the comments, after it came off the front page, and there wasn't a constant stream of them. I didn't feel so out of control. I could appreciate that what I have is special. I'm still up at my portfolio ATH. This spike is insane. It's coming down tomorrow.

Lower highs.
