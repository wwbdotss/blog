Day 4. Trouble sleeping. Crypto too exciting. I'm losing so much sleep. I keep waking up in the middle of night. I can't wait to check prices come morning.

I was going to go to sleep and feeling like nothing is happening, then saw that ETH hit $720. Checked chart. $730. I rushed back to opening all the charts and forums and videos. I'm in trouble.

Didn't watch Tenet again. I took a nap because I woke up too early to check crypto.

I'm at my portfolio ATH again when I woke up this morning. I wonder how long this will last this time. Easy come easy go.
