R came by and dropped off cookies and treats. Homemade nougat. I'm grateful for her and G.

I filled up the shopping cart with random food to meet the delivery minimum and ordered. I didn't feel good about it. Amazon controlled that transaction.

Went for a walk. Went down to the beach this time, Great Highway. I turned off after a few blocks. It was hella cold and I didn't want to keep going. I got some popcorn chicken and boba and ate on a cold park bench. It was miserable. I shouldn't do that anymore.

The lights are flickering again, after like months of steady power.

Crypto...it's sucking my energy dry.

Lights just went out.
