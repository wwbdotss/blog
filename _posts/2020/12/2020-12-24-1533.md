Day 1. The thing that got me excited was trying to determine a goals system. I like having a single text file for things to do today. That I'm keeping. I still need to figure out how to write down all my goals and organize them into an actionable daily agenda. I think the metaphor of a bucket of goals that get sorted into available, manageable time slots makes a lot of sense to me. That was the idea behind the boxlist app I want to do. The sorting part of it is key. Just making a list doesn't work for me.

Took a walk, which was normal today. Not too euphoric but still good. I picked sunglasses but wanted normal glasses at the end because it got cloudy and dark and I hated the dim light.

Used the $100 gift card from work to buy some Amazon groceries.

Gave up on Blockfolio and deleted it. It was slow as fuck. I also have to accept that there was no way I could track crypto exactly. There are always discrepancies and way too many decimal places to match exactly. And the transfer fees and different exchanges and pairs and UTC time conversions. Yeah, I'm not doing that.

I would consider today a wasted day. I will not remember any of it. It's not memorable, and another one into the slush.
