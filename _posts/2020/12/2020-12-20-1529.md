Exercised a little. My ribs almost feeling fine.

Down day because I argued with people on the internet. It's so stupid. Also I'm confronting what I knew before that crypto is not going to make me happy. I'm so far away from the end. The daily ups don't mean anything, and any downs hit me hard. GRT went up a lot, everything I could hope for in terms of entertainment and action, but since I didn't put in everything, even 5x gains don't mean anything in the end. Such a waste. And there's nothing I could have changed. No learnings from next time, because there's nothing I would change in my behavior. The coins that spike like this I would never go all in on. It's not something I would do, so I can't even regret it. So, that means I would never get rich in the short term, and the long term, like always, is my only hope. That saddens me so much. There is no escape. I still have to work for the forseeable future. Years and years. This really sucks. At least a year.

I'm still rooting for GRT though. I want to see how high it goes, to entertain the hypothetical me who did go all in at 13Â¢. So let's see if this can do another 2x before crashing.
