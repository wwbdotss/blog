Day 3, already?? BTC way up. I feel the edge coming. Within two thousand dollars of 1 million. Non stop refreshing. I'm doing nothing but looking at charts and listening to post rock.

Went for a walk, pretty normal uneventful one. Bought chicken pot pie and fries and boba. Amazon groceries came. Didn't watch Tenet because of crypot. That's about it. Thought more about the short story. I'm paying attention, at least, so the text files are still working.
