My bank statement is the most pitiful thing I've ever seen. It didn't register at first, until later, just how totally it encapsulates my life right now.

Two paychecks.
Credit card bill.
Mortgage.
Two $500 deposits to investment accounts.

There is nothing else.

It's like this, month in month out, for fucking *years*.

Just shoot me right now. I'm living the peak-most mediocrity. It's staggering how deep down the middle I've fallen. It doesn't even speak stability to me. It shakes with desperation, barely clinging on to substance. It's one false move, a twitch away from collapse.

Holy shit.
