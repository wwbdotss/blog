Day 2. Overcooked the wagyu a little but it was still pretty good. I don't think though I will ever eat anything better than the first time I tried a steak at Cattlemen's. It's so weird that way. Watched Greenland. Fun. I'll watch Tenet some time.

The goal tracking is a good exercise in indulging my OCD. I really like having everything organized. It relaxes my mind, like I can depend on my system to save me mental attention, and I feel clean. It's great. I feel a stream of continuous good feelings and contentment looking at the orderly lists and text files. I love text files, I know now. It's what I will definitely use to write. No Google docs or Scrivener or Word.

I hope this lasts. I'll keep pushing, past January at least, and make it a habit.

I'm actually working on a short story because I put that on the right kind of to-do list.
