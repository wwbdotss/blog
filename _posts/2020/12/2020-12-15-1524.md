I got so excited donating to gitcoin so I can get more Badger and potential airdrops. It's like a quest log. I spent $5 to send $5 lol. Donated to ETH meme account on Twitter double lol. Felt amazing.

Took a walk. Needed it and felt great to move. Also exercised a little. I'm going to just ignore my ribs.

Listened to a little Taylor Swift. I do like her bare voice. Champagne Problems is a nice song title.
