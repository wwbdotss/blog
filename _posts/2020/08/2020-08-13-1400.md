Should I buy donuts? I like the idea of owning them without buying any. It's max luck. Seems purer. Also, I would have to spend a lot to get 1 million, which is the only reason why I want to buy more, so I could have 1 million of something. Also, I hate the dev's guts, and the initial distribution scheme sucked. OK, decided then, not going to buy any. That's acceptable to me. I'm, can't find the word, ok with it, acceptive? of it. The situation with max regret is a price that somehow makes me feel bad. In between is when I would regret, a little, I guess. It's the zone where my decision now to not buy 1m would hurt the most. This is not going to happen. It's not even going to reach 10 cents.

I really like the novelty of this, and the contorted path I'm taking to make money on this. I posted in a subreddit often enough to get some tokens for free, that I put into a dex in a liquidity pool to get interest? The fuck is this.
