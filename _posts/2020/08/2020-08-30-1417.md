It's only 9:30 p.m. I watched a couple episodes and was surprised it hadn't taken more time.

I'll see if the air purifier makes a difference tomorrow when I wake up in how much phelgm I have. I should also check up if I just have anal fissures or if I have cancer.

I can't sustain all the attention I'm paying crypto. It's getting exhausting. I'll set alarms and not check anymore, especially when I wake up. I slept past 2 last night but woke up before 8. I think I was too excited by crypto to sleep. It's bad. OK I've set alerts. No more checking.

I don't think anything scary is going to happen tomorrow at work, so I'll go with that.

I feel more lost than ever.
