I put in as much effort into my work as I do my exercise. It's a good comparison.

Minimal, enough to get by.

More Terrace House. I'm totally invested. I actually felt so happy for the people on the show. I couldn't help but smile at the sequence of events and how things turned out in the past episode. There were stakes and things at risk, and everything turned out fine. So far, of course. I just gave in at one point and let loose my feelings.

My attention is only on Terrace House and crypto right now. Crypto all the time.
