Web design is so fun. It's still a self-sustaining hobby. It comes directly from the place where I crave absolute control over my environment. And a little creativity and aesthetics. I finished refreshing a site and I feel so clean.

I've been drinking two cans of kombucha and a bag of droewors every day lol. I should probably not drag that habit into the future with me.

Haven't watched Twitch or crypto. I feel good.

Still looking at old photos.

C texted me for some help with an ad she made. I was just glad to talk to her. I called her, to hear her voice.
