Watched Terrace House. It's good. It gets more involved as it goes on, when people get to know each other. It shows me some distinct Japanese cultural things, like how seriously people take jobs, when casual comments about not wanting to play a show immediately triggers someone to re-evaluate someone's work ethic, and personal character. And people are judgey as hell.

I hate work, more than ever. It's my main problem right now. Almost every aspect irritates me. I won't survive this fall.

I'm spending way too much time on crypto. It's interesting to learn more about defi, but it amplifies my greed and I'm yoloing and taking stupid risks on things I don't understand. I almost want things to go wrong and lose all my money so I don't do this anymore.
