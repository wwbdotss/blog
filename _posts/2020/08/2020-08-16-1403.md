Thunderstorms! Woke me up at 4 a.m. last night. It was great. It even rained. The smell of the storm is very evocative. I don't know what I did today. Assorted. Unsorted. I bought a lot of snacks. The RX bars are too sweet. The peanut butter flavor is not good. I have so many bars to eat. The Goldfish came in two of the big tubs I would get individually before. Funny how easily I succumb to marketing and consumer manipulation. I give in. Just hook me up to the system.

Re-reading Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, a chapter sometimes. I don't remember most of it, so it's nice. Murakami has a thing for young girls. He enjoys having full control over those characters.

I bought more Postmates. I'm on a spending frenzy trying to make money mean something, to make me feel better.

I'm keeping Netflix for the next month.
