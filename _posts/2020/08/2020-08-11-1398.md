Of course things crash when it gets interesting. I was a little euphoric and couldn't sleep.

Watched Inside Man again. Still liked it.

Exercised and got a burrito plate and boba.

Didn't work for most of the day.

Couldn't masturbate in the shower anymore. It's weird. Porn has desensitized me. This is the beginning of the end for my body.

I started an inventory of all the things that needed a password. I have so much cruft all over the place. I want to clean and consolidate and cut down on all this *stuff*.
