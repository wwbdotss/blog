It's good not to like watching streams anymore. I've always known, but didn't act on it. Now I am, and it feels hella clear. It's like staying in bed after I wake up. It doesn't feel good on the whole, only in my weakest moments does it feel comforting in that instant. I'm not going to do either anymore. I frame it like, is this what I want to be part of my future? This empty thing I'm doing out of habit, do I want to take it with me, carry it any farther in my life? That no makes it so clear and I don't want those things anymore. Instead, I immediately feel good that I've stopped. If only LilyPichu were more entertaining, I would be stuck watching Twitch forever lol.

I'm glad I decided to open up G's folder from the photo backups to sift through for things I want to keep. There are gems there. The Fanime videos are so good.

I found E's folder too, which was great. He lost a lot from a dead hard drive. I sent it to him.

I'll be browsing old photos all night.
