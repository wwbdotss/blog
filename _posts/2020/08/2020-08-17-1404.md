Succumbed to watching some streams out of loneliness, boredom, and needing something with low attention requirements when eating. The tofu soup was ok, not something I would crave to get again though.

Walked a lot, all the way to the polo field this time. Listened to crypto podcasts.

My lotto check came! It's cool just having it, aside from the money. It congratulated me :D
