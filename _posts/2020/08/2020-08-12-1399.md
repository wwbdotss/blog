r/bitcoin is a cult-ass place the more I compare it to r/cryptocurrency or even any of the eth subreddits. It feels like you have to toe the line or get banned. No fun there.

I'm thinking way too much about crypto. I do want to buy more and play with DeFi and see what happens. I also want more donuts.

I drew out all the bank accounts I have and how they connect with each other and it's a whole thing. I am all about redundancy and backing up this month. I pre-ordered a Pixel 4a so I could have a second phone in case I lose one. I have backup bank accounts and backup exchanges. It caters very much to my need for security and tidiness.
