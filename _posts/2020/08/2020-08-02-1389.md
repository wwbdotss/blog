Didn't look at crypto or streams. Feels good.

Spent all day trying to migrate to Gitlab. It's fucking stupid. I hate everything about it. Tech problems and solutions are so arbitrary. I'm just randomly googling around looking at people's posts and trying any old thing to see what works. There's nothing technical about tech. It's not orderly or intellectual or logical. It's a sand pit full of wet chickens fighting.

Went for a walk and felt better. My legs and body felt good. No headache either.

Read Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom. It's good. I appreciate the layers. Well put together.
