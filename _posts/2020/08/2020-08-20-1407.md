I should not have slept on it lol. Omg.

I just went all the way yolo why not. I don't care about money apparently. I'm already past the point of recklessness, what's another 2x recklessness on top of that.

Work sucked. I did exercise today though.

I also just opened up all the windows after two days of not. I'll close them when I sleep. It's hell outside.
