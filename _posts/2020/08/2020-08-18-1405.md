Well. PTO's over. Last day. It went by as fast as I thought it would.

I set a limit order for $420.69 lol. I love it. If it doesn't hit today, I'll just market buy. I want my donuts.

I still don't know how much crypto to buy. I ordered some international and US index funds already. Don't know what to do with it. I'm going to be tempted to just buy more crypto. I don't want to buy more stocks. I'm semi-decided then. Just get more ETH and...I don't know. Do I want to try defi? I'd rather hold on to the ETH, and I sure as hell don't want to use it as collateral to borrow shit. I don't want to buy donuts with real money either, so no liquidity pools.

$420.69 hit!

I took a nap, and that was the best use of my time.
