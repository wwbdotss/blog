Been uploading all my photos to Google. It's easy. Feed the machine. Bought a lot of things recently. Hard drive, two of them, to start cleaning up my digital things. I want to simplify everything and tighten up security. My passwords and phone and everything are way too loose. Bought more kombucha and droewors. Soylent. I have things I need to expense and get refunds. Plus the lotto. I want things squared away.

Nostalgia is also rising as I look at photos. It's such a stark contrast of how much I did back then versus now, when I don't do shit.
