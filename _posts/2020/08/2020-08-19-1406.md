My brain has been completely taken over by defi and greed and fomo. It's amazing monitoring my feelings as this is all happening. I'm about to trade, for no real reason other than just pure greed blinding me to any reasons not to do it. There's also novelty; I'm bored as fuck with playing it safe. I want to do something reckless. Also, I hate my job so much. Maybe, probably, probably not. I don't care. It's not enough to change my life and the only thing I would do with it is to buy a car that I don't even care about. Losing it in some blaze of idiocy would at least be entertaining. It would also be nice to not have the small account on Delta anymore. I don't want to check prices like that and watch it creep up slowly. And donuts are super old news now, I don't care. It doesn't make me feel anything. Not like YFI!

I'll sleep on it. Tomorrow
