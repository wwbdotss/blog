ETH reached 415. BTC 12100. Then both crashed 20%. Old hat. It reinforces my belief not to bother with short term fluctuations. It's still entertaining though. I've set my alerts and glad to not watch charts for a while.

Returned the big router. UPS store scanning a code for returns is a nice feature. Bought boba. Four seasons tea. Couldn't tell the difference in taste from other milk teas.

Actually looked into Gitlab. The transition is not going to be that bad.
