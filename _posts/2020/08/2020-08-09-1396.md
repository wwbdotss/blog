I need more time to dive into rabbit holes. Hours rush by so fast when I'm trying to figure something out. It's fun. How do I get text to wrap around a fixed element when I scroll?

I found some Javascript and managed to pare things down to a point where it works, but I can't get it to work on my own project. So close and so far away. I'm giving up for the night. Stupid Sunday ending feelings.

Pizza for dad today.
