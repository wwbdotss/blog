More ATH. So. I'm going to make a decision here. I'm not going to sell, at least for a year. +50 ETH means nothing to me. Going to be exciting.

Walked a lot today. To the Great Highway, which was closed to cars so everyone's just walking and biking in the middle of the road. So good. The traffic lights changing colors overhead gave it the apocalyptic feel.

Bought the too-salty cajun chicken salad, then some pies for V, and boba. The walk from that point home is long. I stopped at the reservoir, drank boba on a bench in the high cold fog. It was pretty good.

Hm. Does +100 ETH mean something to me? No. I may have to pull the plug at +500 though. I don't think I can resist. But I'm getting ahead of myself. I will -50 before +500. I see a hard lesson looming somewhere ahead of me.

I'm losing sleep over this. Checking prices instantly wakes me up like no alarm could.

It would be crazy if my dreams came through and I could quit my job this fall. It would be a miracle. Beyond a miracle.

I'll just watch more Terrace House and ignore my phone the rest of the night.
