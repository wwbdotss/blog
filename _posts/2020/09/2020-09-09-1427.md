Sun didn't come out. Burnt orange and dark all day. It's crazy. What else is going to happen?

C went out and sent me pictures. Really liked that we texted.

Did actual work, which still feels good regardless of what I think about my job.

And crypto was up, so that gelled everything into a nice goo.
