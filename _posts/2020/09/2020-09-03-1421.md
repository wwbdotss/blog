Kind of hot. No hoodie just t-shirt. Feels loose and light.

Everything was down today. I can't keep checking prices anymore. I still did though, and had to force myself not to. I really like that feeling crypto gives me though. It even made me less anxious about work today. That was the amazing part. I'd so much rather give that my attention than work, it's not even close. That gives me a glimpse of what could be, where I actually cared about what I did, and wanted to do, instead of the job I have now. I don't know what to do with that though. I'm so self-destructive in this way. Watching charts is useless, and I'll get fired from what's feeding me and paying the mortgage.

Crypto really gets me out of bed. That's also amazing. I look forward to waking up every morning. That was to be worth something right? I guess if I were addicted to drugs, that would also get me up.
