I actually get angry really easily. I'm on a hairpin trigger. Especially around dad. I'm just tense and coiled up, waiting for him to say something about why I'm not trying hard enough to get a girlfriend. I will explode again like last time.

I can definitely feel my emotions sweeping me away. At a certain point, I lose control and it's very discernible, the boiling point. I start shaking.

It's going to be easier and easier not to check crypto. It's down apparently, and I'm glad I can stop. It really is pointless, checking prices and obsessing. Would be sick if I could not look for a year.

Worked late. It's cause I didn't work earlier. I think I prefer this. I can't get anything done if not left alone, during the regular work hours. I hate getting interrupted. I don't want to communicate.
