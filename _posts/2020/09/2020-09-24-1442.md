The delayed gratification of not checking crypto prices didn't lead to gratification at all. That was pointless. I'm just going to not pay attention. Even the vault thing I was excited for yesterday didn't turn out to be all that. It's just going to be 7 or 6 lousy percent a year. That's not going to keep my interest or make me rich. I deleted the tracking spreadsheets too. Seeing fractions of a fraction of a percent each day is not encouraging, interesting, productive, or anything. It's just a waste of time.

End of the month is still the next check point. After that, I just give up. I'm not going to buy any more. Next year maybe. But then again, what else am I going to do with the money? I need to save for taxes. That's something. The savings rate is insulting and I don't want to accept it. I have enough already, actually. I guess I'll be buying more crypto.

I just looked at all the crypto things I wanted. No regrets.
