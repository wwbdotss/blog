Did accounting. It was nice. It is a spike for sure. I'm really curious what the end of the year will look like. It just looks like the other side of the spike is coming. It'll just look improbably that it'll get steeper.

Exercised, felt good.

I should watch the Caspian stream I bought. Work ruined the buzz, so I'm not in the best mood for it. I should watch it anyway.
