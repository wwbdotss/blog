Crypto down. SUSHI is hella entertaining.

Mailed office keys to boss, and got boba. It was harsh and hot outside, air quality and heat.

Spent rest of the day on crypto Twitter.

I feel a big urge to invest right now. Things are going to keep falling for a long time.

Also, bought mediocre sushi. Affordable tuna sashimi sucks.
