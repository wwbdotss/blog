Friday, slacked off and didn't work. I need to put more and more distance between me and work to not go crazy.

Took a walk that tired me out so much that I went to bed at 9 and then woke up at 1 a.m. and couldn't sleep for the next couple of hours, groggy drifted in and out until 11, almost noon. It was the worst sleeping scenario. I lost the best hours of the week during Friday night and Saturday morning. Fuck.
