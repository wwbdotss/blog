Weird morning dreams. I worked a few hours. It's the only peg today. Everything is wisp.

Saw everything was down when I woke up, so didn't check prices the rest of the day. Feels good. I should probably sell and just pay the tax on the short term cap gains. I want to move back into ETH.

Checked prices; I have no self-control.

I want to sell 25% for 100 ETH. That's greedy, but I only want to sell for ridiculous ROIs.

I honestly don't know what I want anymore. I have no motivation to sell because I don't have anything to buy with that money except freedom in the form of early retirement, and that requires more than 10x the money I have now to make it happen. So I have to pretty much force myself to sell to realize some kind of profit after 7 years of this crypto stuff.
