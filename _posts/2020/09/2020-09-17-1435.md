Doing that review for an hour sucked all life out of me. I took a nap right after. It sucked.

Will not try to work tomorrow.

I really need to see the doctor about my butt bleeding. I want to poop normally, and can't take that for granted ever again.

I also need to go to the dentist.

Get haircut.

Go for a walk. The air was just green for two days. Yellow again.

Haven't slept well because of anxiety and crypto. Not anxious about crypto but too excited about it to sleep. I can't stop thinking about it and making plans. It felt really good at first sorting out what I'll sell and under what conditions. Much cleaner.
