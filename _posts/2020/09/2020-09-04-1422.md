The things I was dreading about work wasn't as bad as I thought, but they weren't good either.

I'm worried about my butt. Why won't it heal? Colon cancer.

I bought some snacks online. I'm so food insecure, among other types of insecure. Housing. Future. Work. Family. Friends. Finances. Body, health. Just insecure about everything. I crave guarantees and immunities that don't exist.

Watched Away, skipped over a lot of the family drama and things not related to the Mars mission. Just watched first, penultimate, and last episodes actually. Landing on Mars would be so amazing to witness. I'm just imagining the triumph. What else can give people that feeling? Nothing else.

Three day weekend, and it's going to go by like nothing. I'm already prepared for the dissatisfaction. I have minimal expectations. I just enjoy sleeping in, that never gets old. Boba I guess. Walking around to get food.

Crypto is bleeding and not fun to watch while it's doing that. Vaults are not earning anything. Boring after the rush last week.

Skipped to the end of the season for Terrace House just to watch how it ends. I really didn't connect to the new people in the latter half.
