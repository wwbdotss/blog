Worked a lot, and I compensate by staying up and watching Youtube. I need to mute all crypto from my feed. I can totally make it to the end of the month without checking. The only thing holding me back from a clean break is that I need to move all my YFI into governance.

Hm, wait, there's a new strategy. I had given up on it. This genuinely excites me.
