Didn't check crypto, well, not really, not prices at least, or Reddit. Did go on Twitter and Discord. It frees up time for me to procrastinate on minor chores. I can skip checking crypto again tomorrow. That'll be something.

Bought $80 of Korean food from Postmates. I will never use this after Covid. But lucky for Postmates, there is never going to be an "after" Covid.

I have things I'm waiting for. Needlessly or not. Mostly crypto.


- September 30. I can finalize my accounting, and print the data point.

- October 15. Token distributions. w00t. I'm super looking forward to this. I want to see how much all the time I wasted posting earned me.

- October 15. Buy more crypto with next, next paycheck. I'm willing to lose 10%.

- November 5. Waiting for the election to happen so I can remove all hope, and validate my nihilism.

- End of year? Eat with C when restaurants open.

- Jan 1. Finally withdraw from yYFI. At least I can pay taxes next year. There may be a chance the price will drop enough to do withdraw earlier.

I'm spending the saved time listening to podcasts. I should just watch another movie.
