I read a tweet about the Wandering Inn, and that instantly revved up my motivation to write again. It was so easy. I'm going to try again.

My box of random snacks came. Very pleased. There's beet chips, rye chips, spicy chickpeas, chicken bars, canned oysters, and spicy V8.

I tried not letting the spectre of work tomorrow ruin the last day of the three-day weekend. It kind of worked. I didn't try to clutch and hold on to the time. I have to learn to just let go and if it feels short, then it feels short. I can't change the passage of time.

I took another nap. It was nice.

I ate three of the chicken bars already. I'm surprised I like them.
