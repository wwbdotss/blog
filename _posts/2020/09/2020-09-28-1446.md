I really like podcasts. Listening to the radio is peaceful. I've associated a lot of good memories to walking, and en route to something, and just having that time to listen.

The episode about insomnia hits the right note right now. Contemplative, and not being able to sleep is not an uncommon thing.

I should not look forward to accounting, because it's over in about 30 seconds, if that, and it's ultimately pointless and disappointing, like a lot of things I look forward to.

A lot of work is a good excuse, an immunity for me, to not have to do other work. I feel immune to feeling like I have to be proactive to do other things, which is a big relief. I can slack off in that area and do grunt work.
