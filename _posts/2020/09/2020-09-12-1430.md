Didn't blog because I stayed up late and was too tired. Like stretching out Saturday nights as long as possible.

I went out for a walk. Needed it, after a week of being inside. The air was supposed to be purple, but I didn't care. There are so many invisible enemies.

Crypto all day. YFI is the only thing I care about. It's amazing how easily my attention shifts. No urge to write like I knew would happen. YFI is very risky though. I never felt this way about ETH. I would never sell that, but not feel comfortable with YFI for the long haul. I can easily see the price drop, even if the project doesn't fail.
