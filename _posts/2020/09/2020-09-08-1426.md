Read a post about a 44 year old fighting colon cancer. No symptoms then suddenly, bam, body full of tumors. It's stupid things like that that makes it so hard for me to take life seriously. No matter if I do all the right things, try my best to be defensive and preventive, chances are none of that will matter and I'll get run over by a bus. I will definitely get cancer. Very specifically, I will get colon cancer. My dad will definitely get cancer. V too. Only one who won't will be grandma, who will live past 100. First aunt already has diabetes. I need to reset my tolerances. I cannot keep pining for a perfect environment to live in, or to somehow postpone my life waiting for that perfect environment before I do any living. It really is just the present and nothing else. How do I operate within that set of conditions? Have no expectations from the universe. Do future-dependent things anyway because YOLO is not the answer. It definitely doesn't mean I should only pay attention to the short term and abandon any long-term thinking and planning. I will just have to do those long-term thinking and planning with no satisfaction or comfort that they will come to fruition, that I will not get what I put it, and do it anyway. I don't know how to live that way.

I'm really scared.
